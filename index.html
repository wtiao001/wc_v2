            <h5>Engineer stole self-driving car data, US prosecuters say</h5>
            <p>SAN JOSE -- Anthony Levandwoski, the former Google Inc. engineer at the center of a high-stakes legal battle over proprietary self-driving car technology in 2017, was charged by federal prosecutors Tuesday with stealing trade secrets and selling them to Uber Technologies Inc. </p>

            <p>The indictment follows accusations made in a trial that concluded in February last year by Waymo LLC, Google's self-driving car spinoff, in a contentious dispute to lead the autonomous vehicle industry. It alleges Levandowski stole more than 14,000 files containing critical information on the company's technology, which he then used to form a startup he later sold to Uber. </p>

            <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of California charged Levandowski on 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. He faces up to 10 years and a fine of $250,000 per count if convicted. </p>

            <p>Miles Ehrlich and Ismail Ramsey, representing Levandowski, said their client &quot;didn't steal anything, from anyone.&quot;  &quot;This case rehashes claims already discredited in a civil case that settled more than a year and a half ago,&quot; they said in a statement. </p>

            <p>Uber has been cooperating in the investigation and will continue to do so, according to a company statement. United States of America v. Levandowski, CR1900377 (N.D. Cal., led Aug. 15, 2019). </p>

            <p>Levandowski, who turned himself in to federal authorities Tuesday morning, pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was released after posting a $300,000 cash bond and a $2 million secured bond with his friends and family offering their houses as sureties so he does not flee. </p>

            <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathaniel Cousins disagreed with federal prosecutors about Levandowski being a flight risk, saying he &quot;has repeatedly shown by actions and words that he plans on addressing this in court.&quot; </p>

            <p>The final bail determination will be made at a hearing Sept. 4. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who has an extensive history handling high-profile trade secret and intellectual property cases, will be the trial judge. </p>

            <p>Federal prosecutors accused Levandowski of stealing information, including schematics for proprietary circuit boards and designs for light detecting and ranging sensor technology, or Lidar, according to the indictment. </p>

            <p>The alleged theft of Google's Lidar technology was among the central disputes in the civil lawsuit, which settled for $245 million in February after four days of trial. Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies Inc., 17-CV00939 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 23, 2017). </p>

            <p>Waymo maintained Uber acquired Levandowski's self-driving truck startup, which was bought for $680 million, to hide the engineer's alleged trade secret theft. Uber red Levandowski in May 2017 after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. </p>

            <p>&quot;All Uber has to show for Anthony Levandowski is this lawsuit,&quot; an Uber attorney said during trial.  After seeing evidence to conclude trade secret theft might have occurred, U.S. District Judge William Alsup recommended federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation in spite of the settlement. </p>

            <p>Technology companies regularly sue competitors and former employees to protect their intellectual property, but U.S. attorneys' offices rarely bring criminal charges. </p>

            <p>&quot;All of us are free to move from job to job,&quot; said Northern District U.S. Attorney David Anderson. &quot;What we cannot do is stuff our pockets on the way out the door.&quot; </p>

            <p>Waymo spokersperson Suzanne Philion said the company welcomes the investigation by federal prosecutors and the FBI. &quot;We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation,&quot; Philion said in a statement.  With the most powerful technology companies in the world in his jurisdiction, Anderson promised to prioritize corporate theft and white collar crime cases when he was confirmed as U.S. Attorney in January. The Northern District should be bringing as many major cases as the Southern District of New York, he said. </p>

            <p>The new Corporate Fraud Strike Force will handle the prosecution. </p>

            <p>&quot;The Bay Area has the best and brightest engineers, and they take big risks,&quot; said John Bennet, the FBI special agent in charge of the San Francisco division. &quot;But Silicon Valley is not the wild West. The fast-paced and competitive environment does not mean federal laws do not apply.&quot;  </p>

            <h5>US judge OKs $20M deal between Uber and its drivers</h5>
    
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber Technologies Inc. closed a long-running chapter on a tumultuous legal saga over the ride-hailing service's classication of drivers, a federal judge ruled Thursday.</p>
            <p>Although questions of whether Uber is compliant with labor laws remain unanswered, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said a $20 million settlement to nearly 16,000 drivers is a "fair and adequate resolution in view of the considerations and various risks."</p>
            <p>The approval comes as hundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers rally in San Francisco in support of a state bill that would make it more difcult for companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
            <p>The bill, AB5, stems from a California Supreme Court decision in favor of workers seeking full employment protections, such as minimum wage, worker's compensation and paid sick leave.</p>
            <p>In addition to employee classication, the case is packed with legal issues lawmakers have yet to address, including the enforceability of allegedly "unconscionable" arbitration agreements.</p>
            <p>"The unfairness of policies that continue to exist, matters which are not addressed or disposed of by this litigation, this [settlement] leaves those questions to another case or to another forum," Chen said.</p>
            <p>Plaintiffs led the class action lawsuit in 2013, alleging Uber misclassied drivers because it exercised more than sufcient oversight and supervision of their services. Uber maintained it properly identies workers as independent contractors. <em>O'Connor et al v. Uber Techonologies, Inc., 13-CV03826 (N.D. Cal., led Aug. 13, 2013). </em></p>
            <p>After the judge certied a class of as many as 385,000 drivers, the parties reached a $84 million settlement in 2016. The resolution, which included minor changes to the company's deactivation policy to address complaints it kicked drivers off the platform without explanation and clarication to its tipping policy, would have left the drivers as independent contractors.</p>
            <p>But Chen denied the proposed settlement, nding it "not fair, adequate, and reasonable" in light of plaintiffs' attorneys estimating their damages at more than $850 million.</p>
            <p>As plaintiffs continued to string together a series of wins against their arbitration deals, which were ruled unconscionable by Chen, Uber scored a momentous victory when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal overturned the judge's decision not to enforce the contract provisions. The class shrunk to roughly 15,710 members.</p>
            <p>Plaintiffs' attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan said she anticipated the appellate reversal in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in a relevant case, which upheld class action waivers and reinforced employers' ability to compel arbitration. <em>Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1623 (2018).</em></p>
            <p>Before the high court's 2018 ruling, the National Labor Relations Board regularly struck down such waivers as unconscionable, as Chen did.</p>
            <p>The $20 million settlement was agreed upon in March after both sides re-evaluated risks with taking their claims to trial, following the U.S. and California Supreme Court decisions and uncertainty around AB5.</p>
            <p>While the Dynamex decision bolsters the plaintiffs' case, Uber and Lyft are ercely advocating for a carveout in AB5 to exempt them from having to classify drivers as employees. There is also the possibility the ruling does not apply retroactively. <em>Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, 2018 DJDAR 3856</em></p>
            <p>"Particularly in view of the risks of going forward (including the risk that the landmark Dynamex ruling is now at risk of being curtailed legislatively, as well as the ongoing uncertainty regarding its retroactive application), the proposed settlement provides a tremendous benet to the class," Chen wrote.</p>
            <p>Liss-Riordan defended the settlement by arguing drivers risked receiving nothing.</p>
            <p>While Uber paid a fraction of what it would have if it lost at trial, adverse rulings and outcomes that impacted this case may have aggravated driver frustrations that have compelled state and federal lawmakers to act, according to labor attorney Ryan Wu.</p>
            <p>"Through the Supreme Court's arbitration jurisprudence, we're really seeing the effects of that - workers getting screwed," he said. "I can see how that exacerbates frustrations."</p>
            <p>Wu also noted the landscape to challenge alleged employee misclassication is getting increasingly complicated given state law changing in favor of gig economy workers while changes in federal law "continues going against them."</p>
            <p>"Technology is driving changes in the structure of the economy, including relationships between employer and employee," he said. "The law is trying to catch up."</p>

            <h5>Facebook seeks standing ruling in data privacy dispute</h5>
            <p>Facebook asked the judge overseeing the lawsuit about the Cambridge Analytica scandal to grant a rare appeal that may pause the case while higher courts weigh in.</p>

            <p>Technology companies have long argued users cannot sue them for privacy violations when they are supposedly unharmed as a result of the misconduct.</p>
            <p>Courts have interpreted the defense with varying results. Alphabet Inc.-owned Google got a San Jose federal judge to toss a case by advancing the same argument in 2013 as did Apple Inc. two years earlier.</p>
            <p>Facebook has not been as successful in more recent cases concerning its practices of selling data to third parties and using facial recognition technology.</p>
            <p>Now, the social media giant wants to nally settle the issue. Earlier this month, Facebook asked the judge overseeing the lawsuit about the Cambridge Analytica scandal to grant a rare appeal that may pause the case while higher courts weigh in.</p>
            <p>"The question whether alleged data privacy violations give rise to [standing] is an evolving issue of increasing importance that already has drawn considerable attention from the nation's appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court," longtime Facebook attorney and Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP partner Orin Snyder wrote in the appeal.</p>
            <p>Hostile to Facebook's position that it cannot be sued for selling users' personal information, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria found the company "cannot be more wrong." He ruled in September that hundreds of thousands of users whose data was improperly sold to third parties have standing to sue.</p>
            <p>Chhabria wrote, "Courts have often held that this particular type of intangible injury - - disclosure of sensitive private information, even without further consequence -- gives rise" to sue. <em>In re: Facebook, Inc. Consumer Privacy User Prole Litigation, 18- MD02843 (N.D. Cal., led June 6, 2018). </em></p>
            <p>Facebook's claim that the judge's decision is in opposition to prior court precedent may get the case tossed entirely if higher courts agree.</p>
            <p>Both sides cited rulings in favor of their positions, but Facebook's argument primarily relies on antiquated opinions courts have since moved on from, according to some legal experts.</p>
            <p>Privacy attorney Anita Taff-Rice of iCommLaw said the cases Facebook references are primarily from the early 2010s, before it and other technology companies pivoted to being "data brokers." "</p>
            <p>The standard for standing in privacy cases has evolved," she said.</p>
            <p>Timothy Blood of Blood Hurst &amp; O'Reardon LLP, representing users in the lawsuit, agreed, saying, "That's now the minority view."</p>
            <p>"They're arguing against the trend," he said, adding courts, while not all the way there, are inching toward recognizing data as "personal property."</p>
            <p>Still, both attorneys said the issue is unsettled and will eventually need to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. While the judge may have had stern words for Facebook's argument that it cannot be sued when there is no concrete injury, Chhabria still had to address existing precedent favoring the defense's position in his ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In a 2012 lawsuit over Google's privacy policy integration, U.S. Magistrate Judge&nbsp;Paul Grewal in San Francisco found in favor of Google. He rejected the argument that the "loss of personal information, even in the absence of any cognizable economic harm, was sufcient to confer" standing, according to his order. <em>In re: Google, Inc. Privacy Policy Litigation, 12-CV01382 (N.D. Cal., filed March 20, 2012).</em></p>
            <p>"A plaintiff must allege how the defendant's use of the information deprived the plaintiff of the information's economic value," he wrote. "Put another way, a plaintiff must do more than point to the dollars in a defendant's pocket; he must sufciently allege that in the process he lost dollars of his own."</p>
            <p>Chhabria dismissed Grewal's opinion by explaining later cases "provide ample support for the conclusion that this type of privacy invasion alone creates standing" regardless of "whether or not he was right about precedent at the time."</p>
            <p>Chhabria, who has never been reversed on appeal, said his reasoning is "equally true of earlier district court cases" on which Grewal relied. He was primarily referring to a 2011 case in which U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh dismissed a class action against Apple for allowing third parties to collect users' personal information. <em>In re: iPhone Application Litigation, 11-MD02250 (N.D. Cal., led Aug. 25, 2011).</em></p>
            <p>If plaintiffs' attorneys had to address Grewal's nding later in the case, Taff-Rice said they could easily claim there's already a market for users to sell their personal information.</p>
            <p>"I may be hard-pressed to nd someone that would need my data," she said. "But there are certainly vendors that would trade data for goodies."</p>
            <p>Grewal is now vice president and deputy general counsel for Facebook.</p>
            <p>Facebook also argued a 2016 case concerning "people search engine" Spokeo Inc., which gives users in-depth reports on individuals, should compel Chhabria to grant an appeal. The case bounced around various courts before ending up at the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Spokeo by remanding the matter back to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals because the panel did not properly examine whether the plaintiff suffered a "concrete injury."</p>
            <p>In reaching its decision, the U.S. high court took no position about whether the 9th Circuit's ultimate conclusion that the plaintiff adequately alleged an injury was correct.&nbsp;<em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 (2016).</em></p>
            <p>The appellate court panel noted that determining whether "intangible injuries" give rise to standing to sue is a "somewhat murky area" when it reheard the case.</p>
            <p>"In the wake of Spokeo, the question of whether the alleged sharing of private information gives rise to [standing] has been the subject of much debate in the appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the 9th Circuit," Snyder wrote in Facebook's recent appeal.</p>
            <p>Chhabria will have to balance resolving the case in a reasonable time frame with settling what may be an unsettled area of law that is potentially worth billions of dollars, according to Blood, who said determining damages "is a live issue that hasn't been litigated yet."</p>
            <p>Facebook pointed to another Google lawsuit in which plaintiffs alleged the company improperly shared their private online search terms with third parties in favor of its argument that Chhabria would actually be saving time by granting the appeal. In that case, which lasted nine years, the United States took the position that it was unclear whether plaintiffs sufciently alleged standing because they did not "identify any particular injury that resulted in Google's conduct," according to a friend-of-the-court brief.</p>
            <p>"This court can avoid similar inefciencies and delay by allowing Facebook to take up the standing question now," Snyder wrote.&nbsp;<em>Frank v. Gaos, 2019 DJDAR 2243 (March 20, 2019).</em></p>
            <p>Chhabria will consider whether to grant the appeal at a Nov. 4 hearing</p>

            <h5>Vaping device maker sued over teen’s wrongful death</h5>
            <p>Juul Labs Inc., through its massively popular e-cigarette vaping device, has singlehandedly revived the nicotine epidemic among youth originally spread by tobacco companies, according to attorneys representing the mother of a deceased 18-year-old in the rst wrongful death lawsuit against the company.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in San Francisco, claimed Juul "took advantage of minimal regulations and loopholes for e-cigarettes at a time when youth smoking was at its lowest level in decades" by primarily marketing products with dangerously high nicotine levels to mostly young people.</p>
            <p> As critics are calling for more governmental scrutiny and regulatory oversight, there are now roughly 500 plaintiffs, many of them minors, in consolidated litigation in San Francisco federal court, arguing Juul improperly advertised to teenagers and failed to disclose that e-cigarettes can be more addictive than traditional cigarettes.</p>
            <p> "Juul looked at Big Tobacco's marketing and mimicked it," said Angela Nehmens, representing the plaintiff, who alleges her son died because of the company's vaping device over a year ago.</p>
            <p> Juul e-cigarettes are compact, USB-shaped devices that vaporize nicotine liquid. The company sells a variety of flavored "pods" that are marketed at children, according to the complaint, which claims the number of high school seniors who reported vaping nicotine nearly doubled from 11% to 21% in 2018.</p>
            <p>Daniel Wakefield died of breathing complications in August 2018, according to the suit, and a medical examiner attributed the cause of death to natural causes, noting that he had asthma.</p>
            <p>Wakefield had previously been hospitalized when he was 16, just a year after starting to use Juul's e-cigarettes according to the complaint, for breathing and lung complications. Hospital staff had to apply nicotine patches because he was so addicted to the chemical, the lawsuit states.</p>
            <p> The complaint, which seeks punitive damages, alleges products liability, negligence and conspiracy, among other claims.<em> Vail v. Juul Labs, Inc., 19-CV06597 (N.D. Cal., filed Oct. 15, 2019).</em></p>
            <p>Juul is valued at $38 billion, according to financial analysts at Wells Fargo.</p>
            <p>Altria, the parent company of Phillip Morris, acquired in December a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8 billion. Former Altria executive K.C. Crosthwaite was appointed the company's CEO last month.</p>
            <p> "Being tied to Big Tobacoo alone belies their public statements," Nehman said, referring to Juul tapping Crosthwaite to head the company.</p>
            <p> Juul did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.</p>
            <p> Realizing an opportunity to strike while there was minimal oversight, the e-cigarette maker engaged in a widespread campaign to sell its devices to teenagers, Nehman added. He said the company primarily advertised through Instagram influencers and heavily marketed its flavored nicotine.</p>
            <p>"They knew regulations were going to kick in," she said. "They knew they had a loophole and would have it for a short time."</p>
            <p> Juul suspended all broadcast, print and digital product advertising last month. Plaintiffs' attorney Mahzad Hite, who is also representing Wakefield, likened Juul to tobacco and more currently, technology companies, that "rush to market without studying" their products.</p>
            <p> While Juul presents its product as a safe alternative to cigarettes, Hite said the company never completed the scientific research to substantiate the claim.</p>
            <p> "They reached unicorn evaluation in less than a year at a faster rate than Facebook, Dropbox and Twitter," Hite continued. "That gave them the ability to grow in a way we probably wouldn't have seen if they didn't have that sort of investment."</p>
            <p>The Food and Drug Administration accused the company of failing to prove its products were safer than cigarettes along with illegal marketing practices after a Juul representative told members of Congress in July the product is "totally safe."</p>
            <p> Hite said she expects Juul attorneys to "fight hard and fight dirty, considering how big of an investment Big Tobacco has in Juul and the involvement of Big Tobacco executive in running" the company.</p>

            <h5>U.S. judge grants PG&amp;E access to $5.5B in financing</h5>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The judge overseeing the Pacific Gas and Electric Corp.&rsquo;s bankruptcy approved the utility&rsquo;s request to fully tap into $5.5 billion in financing from major banks Wednesday over objections from an attorney representing thousands of wildfire victims, arguing she could leverage a better deal with more time.</p>
            <p>Attorneys for PG&amp;E and a lender argued they renegotiated the deal to better address U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali&rsquo;s concerns over losing control of the matter if the utility defaults on the loan and delaying a decision jeopardizes its operations and those who do business with it.</p>
            <p> &ldquo;I want the principal parties to cast their own fate as much as they can,&rdquo; the judge said.</p>
            <p> Montali considered PG&amp;E&rsquo;s request to approve the financing at two previous hearings. He continued the decision because of concerns over losing oversight of the utility&rsquo;s restructuring.</p>
            <p> The banks financing the $5.5 billion loan can argue the utility defaulted if it is found potentially liable for another wildfire, according to Cecily A. Dumas, who was appointed to represent tort claimants on March 18, of Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP.</p>
            <p> Montali and U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing PG&amp;E&rsquo;s criminal probation arising out of the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion, have not discounted the possibility they oust management and appoint a trustee to run the company, which could similarly trigger a default.</p>
            <p> PG&amp;E lenders agreed to extend the timeline before they can take action resulting from a default from seven regular days to 21 business days. Montali approved the deal Wednesday because the extension gives the parties more time to refinance the loan. Certain events that trigger a default are not subject to the extension. <em>In re: PG&amp;E</em> <em>Corporation, 19-30088 (N.D. Cal. Bankruptcy Ct.,fi</em><em>led Jan. 29, 2019).</em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;The [California Public Utilities Commission] supports it, and no committee has asserted we don&rsquo;t need the financing,&rdquo; said PG&amp;E attorney Paul H. Zumbro of Cravath,</p>
            <p>Swaine &amp; Moore LLP. &ldquo;This is the best integrated package.&rdquo; Hansen adamantly argued for Montali to approve the financing or risk having the lenders change the terms of the deal and destabilize PG&amp;E operations and its vendors.</p>
            <p> But Dumas, who said she has been &ldquo;told [Montali] will grant this, and that I should sit down and shut up,&rdquo; maintained she is confident she could have a better deal lined up by the next hearing on April 9.</p>
            <p>The financing was an &ldquo;extremely attractive loan for the lenders to make,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
            <p> &ldquo;We see no reason why in an orderly chapter 11 ... we should be in a place for California to save what is a quasi-public service,&rdquo; Dumas said in response to a statement by Montali of what would likely happen if PG&amp;E were to default. &ldquo;What we suggested and was rejected is that the 21 business day offer apply to all events of default.&rdquo;</p>
            <p> Dumas went on to accuse PG&amp;E attorneys of working in bad faith to renegotiate terms of the financing.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;With a little more time, we might have been able to reach agreement,&rdquo; she said.</p>
            <p> &ldquo;Where we ran into a stonewall is the debtors&rsquo; unwillingness to have any interference in its program.&rdquo;</p>
            <p> Outside of a &ldquo;ticking fee,&rdquo; which increases as the loan is awaiting approval, a decision concerning the financing is necessary to stabilize operations for PG&amp;E in addition to its vendors, according to Kristopher M. Hansen, who is representing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
            <p> &ldquo;The issue is ensuring everyone who deals with PG&amp;E, that they have committed nancing and are on stable grounds,&rdquo; the Strookck &amp; Strook &amp; Lavan LLP partner said.</p>
            <p> &ldquo;The more this process plays itself out ... it injects risk into debtor operations and dealing with counterparties.&rdquo;</p>

            <h7>Dec 28, 2018</h7>
            <h5>Utilities commission considers changes for PG&amp;E after deadly wildres</h5>
            <p>State regulators are considering replacing Pacific Gas and Electric Co. leadership, splitting its operations into separate entities or converting it into a publicly-owned utility, among other proposals listed in a recent order.</p>
            <p>The California Public Utilities Commission issued the potential changes in response to allegations the state's largest utility is responsible for causing California's two most destructive wildfires in the next phase of a prolonged investigation into PG&amp;E governance.</p>
            <p>The embattled utility, which did not respond to emailed and phone requests for comment, has long maintained it is focusing on assessing infrastructure and helping to rebuild communities and noted the cause of the fires has not been determined.</p>
            <p>State Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, whose district was severely impacted by last year's wildfires, commented Thursday on the proposals. "To me, the most promising, the one that I believe solves the problem permanently, would be the public ownership of the utility," he said. "I question the business model that PG&amp;E adopted so strongly, which prioritizes corporate profit."</p>
            <p>The commission authorized a probe into PG&amp;E's corporate culture as a part of its probation following the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion and is now expanding the investigation.</p>
            <p>Hill said the most far-reaching of the proposals is to eliminate PG&amp;E as an investor-owned utility and change it into a public-owned utility. This could mean PG&amp;E only providing electric distribution and transmission services and leaving power generation to other entities, according to the order.</p>
            <p>The state's largest utility operates as a regulated monopoly.</p>
            <p>Regulators will also explore whether "part or all of the existing Board of Directors resign and be replaced by directors with a stronger background and focus on safety," Commission President Michael Picker wrote in the order, which also proposes tying the utility's return on equity to safety performance.</p>
            <p>Other options include reorganizing the utility into regional subsidiaries, which would do away with PG&amp;E's current holding company structure. This would divide PG&amp;E into "multiple smaller utilities operating under a single parent company," Picker wrote.</p>
            <p>Proposals for a "stress test," authorized as a part of SB 901 passed in November, on the maximum amount PG&amp;E can pay for wildfire damages without going bankrupt, will also be considered at the commission's Jan. 10 meetings. Critics have called the bill a bailout for the utility because ratepayers will foot the remainder of the balance.</p>
            <p>PG&amp;E faces an estimated $15 billion in liability solely for last year's blazes, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. It is being sued by thousands of home and business owners and insurance companies. <em>California North Bay Fire Cases, CJC-17-0049555 (San Francisco Super. Ct., led Nov. 20, 2017). </em></p>
            <p>Lead plaintiffs' attorneys for the North Bay re cases, Frank Pitre and Michael Kelly, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
            <p>In an order issued on Dec. 13, the CPUC also accused PG&amp;E of falsifying gas pipeline safety documentation from 2012 to 2017. A staff investigation report alleged the utility "falsified locate and mark records" because "supervisors and locators felt pressure to falsify tickets so they would not appear" late, Picker wrote in the order.</p>
            <p>Hill called the development the "tipping point" that prompted the commission to make the proposals.</p>
            <p>The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection concluded PG&amp;E equipment sparked 17 Northern California fires last year and referred its findings to the appropriate district attorneys' offices for prosecution, which may put the utility in violation of its parole if it is found guilty.</p>
            <p>The department has not yet issued reports on the causes of the Tubbs and Camp fires and whether PG&amp;E may be found responsible for the deadliest blazes in state history, which killed 22 and 88 people, respectively. U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing PG&amp;E's probation, demanded answers last month from the utility concerning its role and potential culpability in recent wildfires. He asked for an "accurate and complete" statement of any connection between PG&amp;E and the cause of the Camp Fire in addition to guidance from the state attorney general on the standard to which PG&amp;E should be held if it committed a crime in failing to maintain infrastructure leading up to the blazes.</p>
            <p>PG&amp;E and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra have until Dec. 31 to respond.</p>
            <p>Two weeks before the Camp Fire renewed scrutiny aimed at PG&amp;E, a state regulatory judge also voiced skepticism at the utility's commitment to implementing safety changes.</p>

            <h7>Dec 26, 2018</h7>
            <h5>Future of PG&amp;E, other state utilities, may depend on state legislation next year</h5>
            <p>State lawmakers are split on how the Legislature should address wildfire-related costs and liability for utilities, with a primary focus on Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</p>
            <p>Some want to save the embattled utility from bankruptcy in what critics have called a bailout while others are calling for drastic changes to be imposed on the company in the wake of allegations by plaintiffs in lawsuits that PG&amp;E equipment caused what is now the worst wildfire in state history.</p>
            <p>The blaze was second only to last year&rsquo;s wildfires, which were also alleged in lawsuits to have been caused by the utility&rsquo;s poor infrastructure and management.</p>
            <p>State Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, and Assemblyman Chris Holden, D-Pasadena, stand on opposite sides of proposed legislation designed to extend liability protections from SB 901 to the state&rsquo;s largest utility for potential costs related to&nbsp;wildfires in 2018.</p>
            <p>SB 901, passed in September and introduced by state Sen. Bill Todd, D-Napa, affords utilities more flexibility in covering costs from last year&rsquo;s wildfires and in those to come but not fires started in 2018. It will allow PG&amp;E to pass wildfire-associated costs from 2017 onto ratepayers with approval from the California Public Utilities Commission.</p>
            <p>The legislation empowers the commission to employ a stress test to determine the maximum amount PG&amp;E can pay without going bankrupt, as it has repeatedly warned it would, and shift the remainder of the balance to the utility&rsquo;s customers through higher electricity bills.</p>
            <p>Holden plans to propose legislation filling that hole in coverage by offering the same option for wildfires started in 2018, according to legal observers.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very concerned,&rdquo; Holden said in December. &ldquo;I think there are a very fragile set of circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>A PG&amp;E spokesperson could not be reached for comment for this story.</p>
            <p>But in an SEC ling last month, the company warned: &ldquo;While the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation, if the Utility&rsquo;s equipment is determined to be the cause, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&amp;E Corporation&rsquo;s and the Utility&rsquo;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The chairman of the Assembly Utilities and Energy Committee was forced to delay the bill&rsquo;s introduction from December to January because of renewed scrutiny aimed at PG&amp;E following the Camp Fire, according to The Utility Reform Network Executive Director Mark Toney.</p>
            <p>But Hill, who was a vocal opponent of SB 901, has urged lawmakers to consider PG&amp;E&rsquo;s history of misconduct and negligence before approving further legislation forcing ratepayers to foot the bill.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What would be the incentive now for PG&amp;E to act any differently when they know they can get a bailout?&rdquo; Hill asked.</p>
            <p>The controversy concerning legal culpability centers around the standard of strict liability under inverse condemnation utilities are held to when their equipment or infrastructure cause res, which in turn destroy personal property. Utilities are liable for all resulting damages, regardless of whether they were negligent or engaged in any wrongful conduct.</p>
            <p>Utilities have argued the legal doctrine keeping it accountable for damages, which is unique to California, unfairly holds them to an unreasonable standard, according to Bradford Kuhn of Nossaman LLP, who chairs his firm&rsquo;s eminent domain and valuation practice group.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;To apply a blatant strict liability standard regardless of whether you did something wrong is a hard position for utilities to take,&rdquo; Kuhn said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard position for them to sustain permanently as wildfire risks increase with climate change issues and as California builds out into more dense areas.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>PG&amp;E has maintained that last year&rsquo;s historically hot and dry weather was beyond its control and that increasingly destructive wildfires are to be expected because of climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown reinforced the utility&rsquo;s claims by calling the state&rsquo;s most recent wildfires &ldquo;the new normal&rdquo; in August. Brown suggested legislation in July which aimed to upend the current system of inverse condemnation, instructing the courts to consider whether a utility acted reasonably and complied with safety regulations.</p>
            <p>The courts would have to &ldquo;balance the public benet of the electrical infrastructure with the harm caused to private property and determine whether the utility acted reasonably,&rdquo; according to the proposal. State lawmakers abandoned the initiative at the beginning of August because there was not enough time to settle the contentious issues before the end of the legislative session, according to Hill.</p>
            <p>The Utility Reform Network has similarly argued for treating all wildfire damage and liability under the same standard of reasonable conduct. It has advocated for a state catastrophic wildfire insurance fund patterned after Florida&rsquo;s hurricane disaster fund, which would also be paid for through a property tax</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at all wildfire liability and not just isolate the utilities&hellip;,&rdquo; Toney, the network&rsquo;s executive director, said. &ldquo;But if fires is caused by negligence, that shouldn&rsquo;t be covered under the fund.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Governor-elect Gavin Newsom worked closely with PG&amp;E as mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. He has opposed efforts to convert it into a municipal utility. Nearly all of the utility&rsquo;s top executives, including CEO Geisha Williams, contributed to his gubernatorial campaign.</p>
            <p>Attorneys representing thousands of plaintiffs from last year&rsquo;s fires have been critical of utilities&rsquo; efforts to change inverse condemnation laws. They argued the wildfires were avoidable had PG&amp;E, which has spent at least $6.2 million lobbying state legislators since the 2016 election cycle according to the Secretary of State, properly managed its equipment and operations leading up to the blazes.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;PG&amp;E&rsquo;s well-documented disregard for safety regulations, and blind eye towards the use of effective maintenance and inspection practices for their facilities and equipment in light of an aging infrastructure, lies at the root of the various factors which caused and contributed to causing some of the most destructive and deadly wildfires California has ever seen&hellip;,&rdquo; wrote Frank Pitre of Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP in a complaint. The co-lead attorney for the individual plaintiffs said the North Bay lawsuits are on track to start August 2019.</p>
            <p>The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection found PG&amp;E in violation of state safety laws in 17 of last year&rsquo;s res. It referred its findings to the appropriate district attorneys&rsquo; offices for possible criminal prosecution, which may put the utility in violation of its parole following the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion.</p>
            <p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has estimated that PG&amp;E faces as much as $17.3 billion in damages from wildfires that swept across Northern California last year. It has put the company&rsquo;s potential liability at the forefront of the legislative debate as to whether inverse condemnation laws should be rewritten to give utilities more wiggle room and if it should be allowed to pass costs onto ratepayers.</p>
            <p>PG&amp;E was brandishing the threat of bankruptcy to force legislators to bail them out, according to Toney, who said they caved in passing SB 901. &ldquo;It is a scare tactic that has no basis in reality,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p>The utility should instead be put on a payment plan &ldquo;just like they&rsquo;re trying to put ratepayers on,&rdquo; if shareholders are not able to cover the extent of their liability, Toney added.</p>
            <p>Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. independently determined that if PG&amp;E were held liable in the range of $10 billion to $15 billion for the 2017 blazes, as most industry experts estimate, the net cost to the utility would be as little as $3.75 billion to $5 billion since insurance companies are likely to settle their claims for cents on the dollar, according to Hill.</p>
            <p>Since state regulators already determined PG&amp;E can afford to pay out roughly $3 billion in costs related to the 2017 wildfires, the utility should have to securitize make the remainder of the balance, he added.</p>
            <p>Converting the investor-owned-utility into a municipal utility is also on the table as a more sustainable solution, according to the state senator, who asserted that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is the largest municipal utility in the country and operates with lower rates and safer management.</p>
            <p>Hill said California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker indicated that state regulators are &ldquo;looking at and are making sure they have all the tools in place to do what they need to do to maybe structurally change PG&amp;E.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In a public commission meeting in December amid chants by protesters of &ldquo;no bailout,&rdquo; Picker said the company &ldquo;lacks a clear vision for safety&rdquo; and will face a comprehensive review because of alleged negligence leading up to the Camp Fire.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some fundamental problems here, so I think everything is on the table ranging from a state takeover to them being bought out by another company,&rdquo; Toney said. &ldquo;What is not on the table is business as usual.</p>

            <h7>Aug 14, 2019</h7>
            <h5>PG&amp;E and bondholders debate competing bankruptcy proposals</h5>
            
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Two groups, including some unlikely allies, formed Tuesday at a hearing to discuss whether a bankruptcy judge should open the door to competing proposals to reorganize the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. </p>

            <p>One side features a committee of bondholders -- backed by a ratepayer advocacy group, labor unions and other major creditors -- seeking to terminate PG&amp;E's exclusive right to come up with a plan, arguing consideration of its $30 billion proposal will result in a &quot;competitive process.&quot; </p>

            <p>The other side features PG&amp;E, which has unexpectedly teamed up with the group representing wild re claimants and shareholders to preserve the utility's window to submit a reorganization proposal, accusing opposing committees of working in &quot;bad faith&quot; to &quot;benefit economically&quot; at the expense of other parties. </p>

            <p>&quot;Let's be realistic. They are not here as altruistic players but to acquire the company at a substantial discount and enhance their claims,&quot; said PG&amp;E attorney Stephen Karotkin, who said there will be a plan led by Sept. 9. </p>

            <p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco did not make a final ruling on the matter. </p>

            <p>Expecting a contentious hearing after he rescheduled the issue for three weeks to see if a procedure to submit competing plans could be negotiated, Montali reminded attorneys in the packed courtroom that the only way to &quot;move the ball forward&quot; is to ensure fair process to wild re claimants. He said the standard to allow for consideration of plans is whether they are &quot;credible and confirmable.&quot; </p>

            <p>While confirmable is &quot;somewhat precise,&quot; credible is a &quot;vague term that you know when you see it,&quot; he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;The question is will it foster dialogue and move things forward to a resolution,&quot; Montali said of terminating PG&amp;E's exclusive right to submit a reorganization. </p>

            <p>The judge's primary concern is whether siding with the utility on the issue will make the June 30, 2020 deadline to participate in AB 1054's multi-billion-dollar wild re mitigation fund more difficult, if not impossible, to meet if the utility's plan is unconfirmable.  Abid Qureshi, representing the bondholders, argued Montali is right to be worried because the &quot;path to confirmation is tight.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;We have no way of knowing [if PG&amp;E] will get the financing they need to get to,&quot; he said, referring to the utility's downgraded credit rating. </p>

            <p>The Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP partner added that the bondholders submitting their reorganization plan spurred competition. </p>

            <p>&quot;Let's look at what's occurred. All of a sudden there's been all sorts of activity,&quot; he said. &quot;It's been a galvanizing factor. It's brought people to the table.&quot;    Montali asked what to make of what he and some parties consider a &quot;bargain basement deal&quot; to essentially acquire all of PG&amp;E.   Qureshi responded that none of the criticisms are &quot;gating issues&quot; and will be addressed at later hearings. </p>

            <p>The bondholders' proposal would inject $30 billion into PG&amp;E in exchange for stock, which critics say would allow the group to own 85% to 95% of PGE at roughly $10 billion less than what it is worth. </p>

            <p>Karotkin argued Montali should maintain the &quot;classic and traditional way to get to the point where plan processes should start&quot; because an estimate of the wild re claims is necessary to come up with a confirmable and credible proposal. </p>

            <p>&quot;No plan knows what the funding amount will be required under the statute,&quot; he said of AB 1054's requirement that wild re claims be paid in full, in accordance with a settlement agreement or whatever Montali estimates as the utility's total liability.  Allowing competing plans to proceed will &quot;polarize the parties&quot; because nobody is an &quot;altruistic player&quot; despite what the bondholders say, Karotkin continued. He added that PG&amp;E should retain its exclusivity because it is the only &quot;honest broker,&quot; which prompted heavy laughter in the courtroom. </p>

            <p>While she ultimately sided with PG&amp;E, Cecily Dumas, representing the committee of wild re claimants, was hard-pressed to take a position since none of the plans &quot;have set forth proposals that are remotely acceptable.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Every one is a nonstarter,&quot; she said, explaining the committee would prefer to wait until the claims estimation process is complete to take a position on the issue so all parties understand the extent of the utility's liability. </p>

            <p>Dumas later clarified that every party has negotiated with the expectation that PG&amp;E will not be found liable for the Tubbs Fire, that there's no value attributed to personal injury and that other uninsured losses have no value. </p>

            <p>&quot;For the purposes of other parties coming in to give you choice and competition, they are echoing the debtors' position,&quot; she said. </p>

            <p>Wild re claimants are &quot;not optimistic that simply lifting exclusivity will solve the problem of the intractable gulf&quot; between the positions staked out by the negotiating parties, Dumas concluded. </p>

            <p>Montali will consider whether to establish a wild re claims estimation procedure at an Aug. 14 hearing. </p>

            <p>A group of insurers also argued to terminate PG&amp;E's exclusivity to allow consideration of its proposal but received less consideration because no party supported its position. </p>

            <h5>Prominent attorney who resolves tough cases has challenges in settling Monsanto lawsuit</h5>
            <p>Courts across the nation call on Kenneth R. Feinberg to resolve seemingly unresolvable cases. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco did the same last week when he tapped the Washington, D.C.-based attorney to mediate settlement discussions in roughly 900 lawsuits alleging Monsanto's Roundup weed killer causes cancer.  Kenneth R. Feinberg </p>

            <p>Several legal observers called Feinberg the ideal person for the job. He has facilitated settlements in complex, high-profile cases such as the Sept. 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Volkswagen AG's diesel emissions scandal. </p>

            <p>But statements following the most recent state court verdict in May suggest he will have a substantial gap to bridge between the two sides. </p>

            <p>&quot;[He] obviously has a lot of experience in this realm, but I'd be surprised to see a settlement anytime soon,&quot; said University of Georgia School of Law professor Elizabeth C. Burch. </p>

            <p>The company has maintained domestic and international regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, continue to find no adverse health effects associated with Roundup exposure. </p>

            <p>While settlements may be unlikely, agreed UC Hastings School of Law professor David Levine, a combination of Feinberg's resolutions of the Agent Orange product liability lawsuits and asbestos litigation may serve as a replicable template. </p>

            <p>More than 13,400 plaintiffs across the country have alleged exposure to Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lyphoma. In re: Roundup Liability Litigation, 16-MD02741 (N.D. Cal., led Oct. 4, 2016); <span class="ital">Pilliod v. Monsanto Co.</span> , RG17862702 (Alameda Super. Ct., led Nov. 16, 2017). </p>

            <p>The resolution of the Agent Orange lawsuits, in which Vietnam War veterans and their families alleged injury from exposure to chemical herbicides, created a $180 million settlement fund. The program was unique in that the eligible plaintiffs did not have to prove causation between exposure to the chemical and their condition in exchange for surrendering compensation proportionate to their injuries. </p>

            <p>&quot;Proving exposure to Roundup caused your cancer, that's going to be the hardest part,&quot; Levine said. </p>

            <p>The incentive for plaintiffs to settle for a smaller award is the certainty of a payout on specific causation claims that are difficult to prove considering non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a common and typically idiopathic cancer, he said. </p>

            <p>But the Agent Orange settlement did not provide payment to plaintiffs who developed an illness after the eligibility period, which was common because conditions associated to Agent Orange exposure, like Roundup exposure, take decades to develop. </p>

            <p>Although the &quot;claims procedure did not work as well&quot; in the asbestos litigation, Levine added, it created a trust in which claimants not yet diagnosed with an illness at the time of the settlement could receive a payout. </p>

            <p>Among the most difficult aspects of reaching a settlement in the Monsanto cases, like the asbestos lawsuits, will be determining the different classes of plaintiffs, according to Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Andrew Pollis.  Attorneys may want to ensure a process in which people who have been exposed to Roundup and are concerned about their increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma can receive a settlement proportionate to their injuries if they develop cancer down the road. </p>

            <p>&quot;That's something I would look for as a plaintiffs' attorney,&quot; Pollis said. &quot;For those people to then be transferred into a different class of claimants.&quot; </p>

            <p>Still, legal observers were skeptical about the chances of a settlement in the near future because Monsanto is coming to the table at a point in litigation when the plaintiffs have the most leverage after three jury verdicts against the company in the last year. </p>

            <p>&quot;As this litigation is still in the early stages -- with no cases that have run their course through appeal -- we will also remain focused on defending the safety of glyphosate- based herbicides in court,&quot; said Bayer spokesperson Charla Lord in a statement.  Meanwhile, plaintiffs' attorneys have been encouraged by the massive awards totaling more than $2 billion. </p>

            <p>The attorneys who have prevailed in the trials and continue to represent thousands of plaintiffs expressed that they want to continue trying the cases before juries. </p>

            <p>R. Brent Wisner, who was lead attorney in two state court trials against Monsanto said: &quot;At this point, I don't know if we would settle.&quot; Aimee H. Wagstaff, the lead attorney in the first federal Monsanto trial, said, &quot;there's no signal to suggest that we won't continue to have great success at the trial courts.&quot; </p>

            <p>But if there is anyone up to the task, it appears Feinberg has the best shot, legal observers agreed. </p>

            <p>&quot;He's the perfect guy to do it,&quot; Levine said. </p>

            <p>Feinberg declined to comment on Friday. </p>

            <h5>Courts’ revelations of misconduct settlements leave many unanswered questions</h5>
            <p>State courts have paid over $1.1 million since 2010 to settle claims of sexual harassment and discrimination against judicial officers and court employees, according to judicial administrative records obtained by the Daily Journal.</p>
            <p>The courts that paid settlements include those in Alameda, Tulare, El Dorado, Lassen, San Bernardino, Alpine, Tehama, Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties. Several of the settlements involve court employees and not judicial officers. The names of individuals who were accused of wrongdoing are not included in the settlement agreements, with a single exception.</p>
            <p>The names of the judges and the nature of the claims of misconduct also remain unknown in most agreements. The records provided by the Judicial Council and the state courts were heavily redacted.</p>
            <p>The Judicial Council &mdash; at the direction of Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye &mdash; amended the California Rules of Court 10.500 in June to provide public access to judicial administrative records concerning judicial officers who have resolved complaints of settlements &ldquo;for which public funds were spent in payment of the settlement, including any settlement agreement[s] arising from claims or complaints of sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In 2018, we need to rebalance the protections within the rule to ensure that they do not undermine public trust and confidence in the judicial branch or access to information about how taxpayer funds are being spent,&rdquo; Cantil-Sakauye said.</p>
            <p>Because California Public Records Act requests do not apply to the judicial branch, the Judicial Council adopted procedures concerning judicial administrative records in 2010 to &ldquo;provide public access to nondeliberative and nonadjudicative court records, budget and management information.&rdquo; The rule provided that judicial officers were exempt from being named in these records.</p>
            <p>The group assigned to revise the rule in April, headed by 4th District Court of Appeal Justice Marsha G. Slough, amended the exemption to ensure that the names of judicial officers were not exempt from being disclosed.</p>
            <p>But the records disclosed by the Judicial Council and several superior courts leave it unclear in what capacity multiple judicial officers named in the settlements are involved in the claims of misconduct, if at all.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We note that it is common for settlement agreements to include the names of court executive officers and presiding and assistant presiding judges who sign the agreements on behalf of the court,&rdquo; a council spokesperson wrote in an email. &ldquo;The fact that a presiding or assistant presiding judge or court executive officer has signed an agreement on behalf of the court does not mean that he or she was named as a respondent or defendant in a claim or action.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The counties that paid the most to settle claims include Alameda County Superior Court, which spent $201,000 to resolve two claims of misconduct, and Los Angeles County Superior Court, which spent $322,000 to resolve four claims of misconduct from 2010 to 2012. Santa Clara County also spent $150,000 to resolve a sexual harassment claim in 2013.</p>
            <p>The three courts&rsquo; responsive documents did not name any judicial officers.</p>
            <p>The majority of the settlement agreements also include confidentiality clauses, such as one with Santa Clara County Superior Court.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Parties covenant that neither they nor their agents will, without compulsion of legal process, reveal to any person or entity (except immediate family members, accountants, attorneys or other professional advisors to whom the disclosure is necessary to effect the purposes for which they have consulted such advisors), directly or indirectly, disclose any of the terms of this Agreement or the settlement sum paid to Employee, nor any of the claims or facts which led to the Dispute,&rdquo; according to a June 2013 settlement agreement for $150,000.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Tulare County Superior Court settled a sexual harassment claim against former Judge Valeriano Saucedo for $120,000.Lassen County Superior Court also settled a sex discrimination claim for $135,000 on February 2018, according to records provided by the council. A former judicial officer and former clerk were defendants in the agreement.</p>
            <p>The court did not immediately respond for comment.</p>
            <p>Tehama County Superior Court settled a sex discrimination claim for $150,000 in 2015. The claim was brought by a former court employee against the court &ldquo;asserting that her termination from employment was based on gender discrimination and harassment, and also in retaliation for her protected activities, including whistleblower complaints.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>San Bernardino County resolved a sex discrimination claim in 2016 for $25,000. Alpine County resolved a similar claim in 2012 for $2,500.</p>

            <h5>Trump’s emergency wall declaration faces first legal test</h5>
            <p>The Trump administration's emergency declaration to build a border wall faced its first test Friday as attorneys for 20 states and public interest groups urged a federal judge to temporarily block the project. </p>

            <p>OAKLAND -- The Trump administration's emergency declaration to build a border wall faced its first test Friday as attorneys for 20 states and public interest groups urged a federal judge to temporarily block the project. </p>

            <p>The president exceeded the scope of his authority and disregarded the interests of Congress by diverting more than $6 billion to fund the proposed thousand-mile wall along the Southern border of Mexico, said a lawyer for the House of Representatives.  &quot;No money may be spent unless Congress actually appropriates it,&quot; Douglas Letter told U.S. District Judge  Haywood Gilliam Jr.    Plaintiffs had to prove the building of and additional financing efforts for the wall would cause irreparable harm to warrant halting construction while the case is decided. The government has maintained the president has the discretionary authority to redirect federal funds for purposes such as &quot;law enforcement activity&quot; and &quot;unforeseen military&quot; priorities. </p>

            <p>Congress approved in February $1.37 billion for construction of a border in Texas. Trump then declared a national emergency to divert $3.6 billion from military construction efforts, $2.5 billion from Department of Defense counter narcotics programs and $601 million from the treasury forfeiture fund to finance additional walls in Arizona and New Mexico. </p>

            <p>The plaintiffs' argument was two-pronged: The diversion of federal funds violates Congress' authority and the construction of the wall itself would harm surrounding communities. </p>

            <p>The Department of Defense is unlawfully redirecting the $2.5 billion meant for counter narcotics programs, which are intended for road lighting and fencing, to build the wall, said plaintiffs' attorney Dror Ladin for the Southern Border Communities Coalition. Congress restricted the building of the wall to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and never authorized construction elsewhere, Ladin said. </p>

            <p>The wall would also affect the use and enjoyment of public land, which higher courts have recognized as enough to grant a preliminary injunction, in addition to harming &quot;New Mexico's sovereign interest in managing wildlife and natural resources,&quot; said Janelle Smith for the California Attorney General's Office. </p>

            <p>The president has said the wall is needed to address a crisis of criminals and drugs coming over the border. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs include 20 states, the Sierra Club and the Southern Borders Communities Coalition. They argued a &quot;flagrant disregard of fundamental separation of powers principles,&quot; among other claims, according to court lings. <span class="ital">California v. Trump, 19- CV00872 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 18, 2019).</span> </p>

            <p>Up last for the plaintiffs was California Department of Justice attorney Lee Sherman, who argued the diversion of treasury forfeiture funds would undermine state law enforcement and public safety. </p>

            <p>Gilliam said he understands the case is &quot;founded on what defendants are doing exceeds what Congress authorized,&quot; but that there needs to be an answer as to where he can make a finding of irreparable harm. </p>

            <p>Sherman said the treasury forfeiture fund, which states are entitled to a piece of, will be &quot;underwater&quot; by the end of the year if construction of the wall is allowed to proceed. Construction in New Mexico is slated to begin next week, and the government has already indicated it plans to divert treasury forfeiture funds as early as next month, he added. </p>

            <p>U.S. Department of Justice attorney James Burnham dismissed Sherman's argument because the fund is a &quot;pot of money states never have access to.&quot; They only have a partial stake in funds seized in coordinated law enforcement efforts, he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;Their theory is if it were to entirely implode, whether entitled to it or not, then they wouldn't get paid,&quot; Gilliam said. </p>

            <p>Burnham responded the &quot;fund won't disappear&quot; since there is roughly $500 million set aside for next year. </p>

            <p>The government attorney next turned to allegations the president unlawfully diverted money that was not approved by Congress, arguing the Department of Justice has the discretionary authority to construct border barriers. </p>

            <p>Addressing the use of money earmarked for counter narcotics programs, Burnham conceded the administration was not planning to use those funds but said Congress never restricted the diversion. </p>

            <p>He also assured the court &quot;no construction would start until at least 45 days until today.&quot;  </p>

           </a>
           <div class="work-content work-expand collapse" data-collapsed="true" id="work-2">
            <h7>Nov 7, 2016</h7>
            <h5>The Come Up: Ivan Rabb stays true to Oakland</h5>
            <p>Ivan Rabb took a seat near the end of his bench halfway through the third quarter of the 2015 California Interscholastic Federation finals in Haas Pavilion. Sporting the Bishop O&rsquo;Dowd black and gold, Ivan could only watch Mater Dei rain fire on his Dragons as he sat hunched with cramps. That&rsquo;s when his assistant coach came up to him, tilted an empty green Gatorade cup and squirted a stream of Heinz mustard into it.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;For the cramps,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p>Ivan peered into the cup and swished the mustard around like a glass of wine so it would slide down easier. He tilted his head back and downed it, chasing the goopy liquid with some Gatorade.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Good to go,&rdquo; he shouted in a nasally voice.</p>
            <p>Less than an hour after Ivan&rsquo;s salty infusion, the Dragons found themselves deadlocked in a tie ball game with 10 seconds left in overtime. On the final possession, Ivan flashed to the left block as the Dragons reversed the ball to the top of the arc and back to lead guard Paris Austin, Ivan&rsquo;s best friend. He dribbled around the three-point line, shielding the ball with his off-arm and stopped right in front of his bench as his man switched stances. That moment of relief from his defender was just enough for Paris to squeeze by and force Ivan&rsquo;s man to rotate off him and protect the rim. A window opened up, and Paris shoveled a pass to Ivan, who was hacked on the arm with just 0.8 seconds left on the clock.</p>
            <p>The players assumed their positions along the paint as Mater Dei&rsquo;s bench sat with their backs slouched and heads fixed on the opposite side of the court. Ivan, a 75 percent free throw shooter, needed just one of his shots to fall for the Dragons to take home the title. He stepped up to the line, took the pass from the referee and started a routine he rehearsed thousands of times. He rose the ball above his head, took two hard dribbles and let it go.</p>
            <p>Airball.</p>
            <p>The crowd belched the sound that kids make when a classmate is scolded.</p>
            <p>Haas Pavilion was packed that Saturday night &mdash; almost at capacity with 10,533 people &mdash; with most of the fans trying to catch a glimpse of their Oakland-grown hero and five-star recruit in his campaign to unseat the four-time defending champion, the Monarchs. Their presence wouldn&rsquo;t hurt Ivan&rsquo;s chances of committing to Cal and staying in the Bay Area either. A high school state championship would be great, they thought. An NCAA championship would be even better.</p>
            <p>Ivan didn&rsquo;t move much while waiting for the second free throw. He says he wasn&rsquo;t even nervous. The entire Mater Dei bench stood in anticipation this time around &mdash; each player adjusting his spot in the scrum to get a better angle at the free throw. Again, he handled the pass from the referee and again, he started the same routine. He rose the ball above his head, took two hard dribbles and let it go, releasing the most important free throw of his high school career.</p>
            <p>Bottom.</p>
            <p>Mater Dei hoisted one last heave at the basket as the entire Dragons roster cleared the bench. The crowd stormed the court. Fans, many from Oakland, shouted and cheered with the Bishop O&rsquo;Dowd squad &mdash; simultaneously celebrating landing on the right side of a state title classic and hoping that enough screaming and shouts of &ldquo;Ivan&rdquo; could convince him to stay in the Bay Area and commit to Cal. Ivan was lightheaded &mdash; from all the salt, he says &mdash; but he embraced the crowd and his teammates as his decision became that much clearer.</p>
            <p>Ivan committed to Cal in his mother&rsquo;s restaurant in Oakland just two weeks after the state championship game.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to be just another player that came in and out of a program and not really be remembered because they had so many great players,&rdquo; Ivan says. &ldquo;Here at Cal, there are so many guys who are from here and from the area &mdash; California or whatever it may be &mdash; but they come and then they leave and go other places.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Ivan&rsquo;s decision, followed by the unexpected commitment from Georgia native Jaylen Brown, led to a huge rise in national and local expectations for the historically mediocre Bears. And following Cal&rsquo;s disappointing elimination in the first round of the NCAA tournament last season, Brown, alongside the other five players ranked ahead of Ivan in the class of 2015, deserted the NCAA wastelands for greener pastures in the NBA. That group included Maryland&rsquo;s Diamond Stone and Kansas&rsquo; Cheick Diallo &mdash; both players who struggled in their lone collegiate seasons and were drafted in the second round.</p>
            <div id="attachment_378023" class="wp-caption alignright">&nbsp;</div>
            <p>Meanwhile, Ivan was simultaneously excellent, underutilized and underrated throughout the year. He was an advanced analytics darling in an underwhelming draft class and looked fantastic as the third option on a loaded team to boot, suggesting he&rsquo;s nowhere near his ceiling. He averaged 12.5 points and 8.6 rebounds on nearly 64 percent true shooting. While none of those numbers may pop off the page, he was the most efficient and productive player on the floor regardless of lineup combination. He recorded a team-best 124.8 offensive rating (Jaylen finished at 98.4, for reference) as he dished ample servings of shimmy and shake in addition to showing off a reliable 15-footer.</p>
            <p>The power forward shouldered 57 percent of Cal&rsquo;s post touches and shot 80 percent at the rim, all while anchoring the No. 1 defense in the Pac-12. He displayed the split-second decision-making that is intrinsic to the best rim protectors and built a reputation for always being at the right place at the right time off rotations. He stymied pick-and-rolls with uncharacteristic lateral foot speed and recognition for a 19-year-old yet to reach his athletic prime. His 95.3 defensive rating doesn&rsquo;t speak enough to how integral he was on that end of the floor for the Bears.</p>
            <p>This is all to say that Ivan could be on an NBA roster right now if he chose to declare for the draft. He neither plummeted in mock drafts because of a gaping hole in his game nor was he injured for any extended portion of the season. He chose to return to Cal for a sophomore campaign. He preferred to stay.</p>
            <p>Ivan said the choice was hard but simple: The NBA will still be there in a year, but this season would be his last chance to leave any sort of lasting legacy in Oakland as a Cal player; to be the face of the faceless Bears.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I just want to represent for Oakland,&rdquo; Ivan says. &ldquo;I think I can be a household name here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Choosing to return for a sophomore campaign was years in the making, back to the days Ivan would wait on 65th Avenue for the bus to school.</p>
            <p>Ivan lived on 73rd in East Oakland. Paris, who lived just three blocks away on 76th, waited at a different stop but always rendezvoused with Ivan on the bus. They go way back. Paris recollects the time someone they knew got killed on Ivan&rsquo;s block when they were in eighth grade. They would say hi and shake hands in passing. He went to high school a couple of blocks from where they lived. He got shot.</p>
            <blockquote class="var-pull-quote">
            <p class="outline">&ldquo;I just want to represent for Oakland. I think I can be a household name here.&rdquo;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;For someone that hasn&rsquo;t grown up in Oakland all their life, it might be sketch to them,&rdquo; Paris says. &ldquo;For us, we grew up with shootings and bad stuff all the time. You kind of become accustomed to it and know to watch your back and be safe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Ivan and Paris always sat together, even when they went to Montera Middle School. Things were different back then. They would gather with a squad of their friends near the back of the bus, many of whom went to the nearby Skyline and Oakland Technical high schools. There was a lot of tomfoolery and shenanigans. There were a lot of fights too. Sometimes the bus driver had to pull over so the students would stop.</p>
            <p>After starting at Bishop O&rsquo;Dowd, Ivan and Paris were suddenly the odd men out. The duo were among the few students at the school from what they liked to call the &ldquo;bottom ground&rdquo; &mdash; the portion of East Oakland below the hills. For the most part, bottom grounders couldn&rsquo;t &mdash; and still can&rsquo;t &mdash; afford to attend the prestigious private institution, where tuition reaches upward of $16,000 for some.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It definitely was a huge change of scenery,&rdquo; Paris says. &ldquo;Even though Montera was in the nice part of the hills, there were a lot of inner city kids that went there. It was a public school. There were a lot of fights and activities going on at school. High school, it was a lot different. Everything was all structured. There were different ethnicities and races at Bishop compared to Montera. In middle school, everyone looked the same.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Damian Lillard, another Oakland-grown star who made it big in the NBA, happens to be Ivan&rsquo;s former neighbor. He had a similar experience growing up, but on a different side of the same coin. He wasn&rsquo;t heavily recruited and attended Oakland High School, the oldest public school in the city.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I think the Oakland school system puts forth a great effort to help the students as best they can, but lack the resources necessary to match the level of some other school districts,&rdquo; Lillard said in an email to The Daily Californian.</p>
            <p>Unlike Lillard, Ivan had a foot in both worlds, and his status as an outsider was not lost on him. Him being the pride of Bishop O&rsquo;Dowd didn&rsquo;t make it any easier or less complicated either. A predominantly white school suddenly boasted Oakland&rsquo;s most highly touted basketball prospect since Jason Kidd. This world of new books, sturdy desks and counselors was new to him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The difference between Montera and Bishop was definitely noticeable,&rdquo; Ivan says. &ldquo;I got all the help I needed at Bishop. We had counselors. We had teacher&rsquo;s assistants in class.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Had Ivan and Paris not gone to Bishop O&rsquo;Dowd, they say, they would have enrolled at Oakland Technical. Parents preferred to send their kids there instead of Skyline, despite Skyline being newer and located in the Oakland hills. This is primarily because of the academic prestige of Oakland Tech relative to Skyline. Graduation rates are far higher at Oakland Tech (89 percent versus 74 percent) in addition to the school boasting better academic programs, including a top-notch engineering academy.</p>
            <p>Skyline was also the focus of a 2012 California lawsuit concerning the quality of instruction by dedicated teachers. Brandon DeBose Jr., then a senior at Skyline, was among the nine plaintiffs who alleged that several California statutes regarding tenure protected ineffective teachers. They alleged that these statutes disproportionately impact poor and minority students, saying they are more likely to be assigned to these teachers. Despite the Oakland hills historically having fewer minority residents, more than 90 percent of Skyline is made up of Black, Latino and Asian students.</p>
            <p class="outline">&ldquo;A lot of performance comes from a child actually knowing the teacher is invested in you doing well &mdash; the support being there and your peers being motivated too,&rdquo; Ivan says.</p>
            <p>Oakland prides itself on its diversity. Part of the reason Oakland Unified School District instituted its open enrollment policy, which allows families to rank the schools they want their child to attend, was in the name of that diversity. But the number of opportunists in Oakland who have taken advantage of the open enrollment policy has played a large part in exacerbating the integration issues that have plagued the city for decades.</p>
            <p>Twenty percent of Oakland Tech students came from the Skyline attendance area last year, while just more than 2 percent of students zoned for Oakland Tech chose to go to Skyline. This resulted in just 24 percent of Skyline&rsquo;s students actually living in neighborhoods that are zoned for the school. On the other hand, more than 60 percent of Skyline is made up of students from East Oakland attendance areas, namely the Castlemont and Fremont high schools.</p>
            <p>It is no secret that the Oakland hills, zoned for Skyline, are home to the wealthier Oakland residents. By deciding that their school is not worth attending, the families that gamed the school district&rsquo;s open enrollment policy got to have their cake and eat it, too.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;(The open enrollment policy) can exacerbate existing inequalities, because it&rsquo;s the families that are most organized and educated that figure out the system,&rdquo; says Board of Education District 6 Director Shanthi Gonzales, who oversees the district Skyline is in. &ldquo;Who do you think are the families that have the time and resources to visit these schools and make these choices?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The NBA has long been a bastion of social activism among the American professional sports leagues. As part of a predominantly Black association, NBA players &mdash; many of whom come from underserved neighborhoods &mdash; understand the impact their leadership can have on small communities. DeMarcus Cousins may always look grouchy, but Sacramento leaders and residents have taken the stage on more than one occasion to sing praises of his community advocacy, most notably his work with kids and with trying to improve community relations with police.</p>
            <p>Ivan is aware of what his outreach can potentially mean to Oakland if he becomes established in the NBA. He sees the influence Lillard has on his hometown and hopes to be among a host of current and former athletes in Oakland &mdash; including Bill Russell and Marshawn Lynch, to name a few &mdash; to return and give back to the community that built them up.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I just want to come out and do some positive things and put people in the position in the future to do positive things,&rdquo; Ivan says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about: giving back to my people. Everybody knows I&rsquo;m representing for Oakland.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>But for now, Ivan has to worry about making it big first. Without Tyrone Wallace and Brown around, the sophomore power forward has largely been focused on his leadership.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Nobody took on a vocal role last year,&rdquo; Ivan says. &ldquo;That was one of the problems. Tyrone and Jaylen spoke up a lot, but there was no specific leader. I felt people were looking to me, and I didn&rsquo;t really realize it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Ivan will have a strong case as the NCAA College Player of the Year with all the touches and leadership responsibilities he can handle next season with the Bears. He embraces the future, eager to earn his place on an even grander stage. He&rsquo;ll get that shot in the very near future, too &mdash; he&rsquo;s pegged as a top-10 pick in a loaded 2017 draft class. Barring a catastrophic season or blockbuster trade, the Warriors most likely won&rsquo;t get a chance to draft Ivan, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean his hometown story will end there. Because when he matches up against LeBron James or Stephen Curry or Anthony Davis with a million eyes watching him, he&rsquo;ll still have one hopeful eye fixed on Oakland.</p>
