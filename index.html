            <h5>Appellate court bail ruling prompts more pretrial releases, but only in some cases</h5>
            <p>Superior courts across the state are holding what have become known as Humphrey hearings to determine a defendant’s financial status and consider bail alternatives in the wake of a 1st District Court of Appeal decision published in February.</p>
            <p>A San Francisco County judge released the man, Kenneth Humphrey, whose appeal was granted last week, but the appellate opinion has had varied results across the state. <span class="ital">In re Humphrey (2018)</span> 19 Cal. App. 5th 1006.</p>
            <p>The impact of the Humphrey hearings largely depend on the district attorney's opposition to pretrial release and the judge's discretion when considering a defendant's flight risk and threat to public safety, according to public defenders.</p>
            <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
            <p>San Francisco County prosecutors have started to advocate solely for no bail orders when it believes the defendant is a public safety threat or conditional release when it does not believe so, according to San Francisco district attorney's office spokesperson Max Szabo. Monetary bail is only imposed when the defendant poses a flight risk, he added.</p>
            <p>"The Humphrey decision came out which [said] that bail should only be set beyond what the defendant can reasonably afford to pay if the court articulates the fact that the individual is either likely to not come back to court and if there are no less restrictive means to ensure that the individual comes back for their court date," Szabo said.</p>
            <p>Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi also said the Humphrey decision has had the effect of judges imposing "no bail more often than they ever did before."</p>
            <p>"We have the same number of pretrial misdemeanor clients in jail as we did before Humphrey," Pozzi said. "This is very disheartening."</p>
            <p>The shift in the office's approach to pretrial release has led to a signficant increase in the number of defendants released prior to trial. In February and March 2017, 1,051 defendants were out on conditional release, according to San Francisco Sheriff Vicki Hennessy.</p>
            <p>That figure jumped to 1,616, nearly a 50 percent increase, in February and March this year, while the number of total bookings remained relatively similar from the same period last year.</p>
            <p>The number of defendants released on the highest level of supervision went up more than 30 percent in March, Hennessy added. She attributed this to the increase in defendants released after felony arrests for crimes such as second degree burglary, child pornography and battery of a peace officer.</p>
            <p>But Adachi said the district attorney's change in its approach fails to address what he said is the constitutional right to pretrial release.</p>
            <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
            <p>More defendants are being held on no bail orders despite more individuals being released prior to trial, Adachi said.</p>
            <p>"By taking that position, the district attorney's office, in my opinion, is working to defeat bail reform," he added.</p>
            <p>In Santa Clara County, Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said arraignment attorneys come prepared with information about their client's ability to pay, ties to the community and programs appropriate to help their client in a "Humphrey-tailored request at the beginning of the arraignment."</p>
            <p>But Santa Clara County prosecutors have not changed their approach to bail and "haven't meaningfully engaged about what kind of pretrial release conditions fit each person's case," he added.</p>
            <p>Although Singh acknowledged more defendants are being let go on conditional release or on their own recognizance, the response has largely depended on the judge hearing the arraignment. Some judges are skeptical about evidence presented by public defenders concerning their clients' ability to pay and set bail as they did before Humphrey.</p>
            <p>In Santa Clara County, there has been a 10 percent increase in defendants assigned to the supervised or own-recognizance release programs, according to Director of Pretrial Services Aaron Johnson.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles County Superior Court bench's application of Humphrey has been mixed, according to Interim Public Defender Nicole Davis Tinkham.</p>
            <p>"Some courts have embraced the individualized bail assessment mandated by Humphrey and are setting money bail only where no alternative exists, while others continue to condition release on the payment of huge amounts of money without regard for a defendant's particular circumstances," she said.</p>
            <p>Although they do not contest bail in specific cases, Los Angeles County public defenders actively monitor bail and seek higher court review when appropriate. But because these motions take time, "many clients held on excessive bail in minor cases plead guilty in order to get out which, ironically, prevents us from seeking review of the court's erroneous bail order in the first place," Tinkham added.</p>

            <h5>Engineer stole self-driving car data, US prosecuters say</h5>
            <p>SAN JOSE -- Anthony Levandwoski, the former Google Inc. engineer at the center of a high-stakes legal battle over proprietary self-driving car technology in 2017, was charged by federal prosecutors Tuesday with stealing trade secrets and selling them to Uber Technologies Inc. </p>

            <p>The indictment follows accusations made in a trial that concluded in February last year by Waymo LLC, Google's self-driving car spinoff, in a contentious dispute to lead the autonomous vehicle industry. It alleges Levandowski stole more than 14,000 files containing critical information on the company's technology, which he then used to form a startup he later sold to Uber. </p>

            <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of California charged Levandowski on 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. He faces up to 10 years and a fine of $250,000 per count if convicted. </p>

            <p>Miles Ehrlich and Ismail Ramsey, representing Levandowski, said their client &quot;didn't steal anything, from anyone.&quot;  &quot;This case rehashes claims already discredited in a civil case that settled more than a year and a half ago,&quot; they said in a statement. </p>

            <p>Uber has been cooperating in the investigation and will continue to do so, according to a company statement. United States of America v. Levandowski, CR1900377 (N.D. Cal., led Aug. 15, 2019). </p>

            <p>Levandowski, who turned himself in to federal authorities Tuesday morning, pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was released after posting a $300,000 cash bond and a $2 million secured bond with his friends and family offering their houses as sureties so he does not flee. </p>

            <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathaniel Cousins disagreed with federal prosecutors about Levandowski being a flight risk, saying he &quot;has repeatedly shown by actions and words that he plans on addressing this in court.&quot; </p>

            <p>The final bail determination will be made at a hearing Sept. 4. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who has an extensive history handling high-profile trade secret and intellectual property cases, will be the trial judge. </p>

            <p>Federal prosecutors accused Levandowski of stealing information, including schematics for proprietary circuit boards and designs for light detecting and ranging sensor technology, or Lidar, according to the indictment. </p>

            <p>The alleged theft of Google's Lidar technology was among the central disputes in the civil lawsuit, which settled for $245 million in February after four days of trial. Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies Inc., 17-CV00939 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 23, 2017). </p>

            <p>Waymo maintained Uber acquired Levandowski's self-driving truck startup, which was bought for $680 million, to hide the engineer's alleged trade secret theft. Uber red Levandowski in May 2017 after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. </p>

            <p>&quot;All Uber has to show for Anthony Levandowski is this lawsuit,&quot; an Uber attorney said during trial.  After seeing evidence to conclude trade secret theft might have occurred, U.S. District Judge William Alsup recommended federal prosecutors open a criminal investigation in spite of the settlement. </p>

            <p>Technology companies regularly sue competitors and former employees to protect their intellectual property, but U.S. attorneys' offices rarely bring criminal charges. </p>

            <p>&quot;All of us are free to move from job to job,&quot; said Northern District U.S. Attorney David Anderson. &quot;What we cannot do is stuff our pockets on the way out the door.&quot; </p>

            <p>Waymo spokersperson Suzanne Philion said the company welcomes the investigation by federal prosecutors and the FBI. &quot;We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation,&quot; Philion said in a statement.  With the most powerful technology companies in the world in his jurisdiction, Anderson promised to prioritize corporate theft and white collar crime cases when he was confirmed as U.S. Attorney in January. The Northern District should be bringing as many major cases as the Southern District of New York, he said. </p>

            <p>The new Corporate Fraud Strike Force will handle the prosecution. </p>

            <p>&quot;The Bay Area has the best and brightest engineers, and they take big risks,&quot; said John Bennet, the FBI special agent in charge of the San Francisco division. &quot;But Silicon Valley is not the wild West. The fast-paced and competitive environment does not mean federal laws do not apply.&quot;  </p>

            <h5>PG&amp;E and bondholders debate competing bankruptcy proposals</h5>
            
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Two groups, including some unlikely allies, formed Tuesday at a hearing to discuss whether a bankruptcy judge should open the door to competing proposals to reorganize the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. </p>

            <p>One side features a committee of bondholders -- backed by a ratepayer advocacy group, labor unions and other major creditors -- seeking to terminate PG&amp;E's exclusive right to come up with a plan, arguing consideration of its $30 billion proposal will result in a &quot;competitive process.&quot; </p>

            <p>The other side features PG&amp;E, which has unexpectedly teamed up with the group representing wild re claimants and shareholders to preserve the utility's window to submit a reorganization proposal, accusing opposing committees of working in &quot;bad faith&quot; to &quot;benefit economically&quot; at the expense of other parties. </p>

            <p>&quot;Let's be realistic. They are not here as altruistic players but to acquire the company at a substantial discount and enhance their claims,&quot; said PG&amp;E attorney Stephen Karotkin, who said there will be a plan led by Sept. 9. </p>

            <p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco did not make a final ruling on the matter. </p>

            <p>Expecting a contentious hearing after he rescheduled the issue for three weeks to see if a procedure to submit competing plans could be negotiated, Montali reminded attorneys in the packed courtroom that the only way to &quot;move the ball forward&quot; is to ensure fair process to wild re claimants. He said the standard to allow for consideration of plans is whether they are &quot;credible and confirmable.&quot; </p>

            <p>While confirmable is &quot;somewhat precise,&quot; credible is a &quot;vague term that you know when you see it,&quot; he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;The question is will it foster dialogue and move things forward to a resolution,&quot; Montali said of terminating PG&amp;E's exclusive right to submit a reorganization. </p>

            <p>The judge's primary concern is whether siding with the utility on the issue will make the June 30, 2020 deadline to participate in AB 1054's multi-billion-dollar wild re mitigation fund more difficult, if not impossible, to meet if the utility's plan is unconfirmable.  Abid Qureshi, representing the bondholders, argued Montali is right to be worried because the &quot;path to confirmation is tight.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;We have no way of knowing [if PG&amp;E] will get the financing they need to get to,&quot; he said, referring to the utility's downgraded credit rating. </p>

            <p>The Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP partner added that the bondholders submitting their reorganization plan spurred competition. </p>

            <p>&quot;Let's look at what's occurred. All of a sudden there's been all sorts of activity,&quot; he said. &quot;It's been a galvanizing factor. It's brought people to the table.&quot;    Montali asked what to make of what he and some parties consider a &quot;bargain basement deal&quot; to essentially acquire all of PG&amp;E.   Qureshi responded that none of the criticisms are &quot;gating issues&quot; and will be addressed at later hearings. </p>

            <p>The bondholders' proposal would inject $30 billion into PG&amp;E in exchange for stock, which critics say would allow the group to own 85% to 95% of PGE at roughly $10 billion less than what it is worth. </p>

            <p>Karotkin argued Montali should maintain the &quot;classic and traditional way to get to the point where plan processes should start&quot; because an estimate of the wild re claims is necessary to come up with a confirmable and credible proposal. </p>

            <p>&quot;No plan knows what the funding amount will be required under the statute,&quot; he said of AB 1054's requirement that wild re claims be paid in full, in accordance with a settlement agreement or whatever Montali estimates as the utility's total liability.  Allowing competing plans to proceed will &quot;polarize the parties&quot; because nobody is an &quot;altruistic player&quot; despite what the bondholders say, Karotkin continued. He added that PG&amp;E should retain its exclusivity because it is the only &quot;honest broker,&quot; which prompted heavy laughter in the courtroom. </p>

            <p>While she ultimately sided with PG&amp;E, Cecily Dumas, representing the committee of wild re claimants, was hard-pressed to take a position since none of the plans &quot;have set forth proposals that are remotely acceptable.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Every one is a nonstarter,&quot; she said, explaining the committee would prefer to wait until the claims estimation process is complete to take a position on the issue so all parties understand the extent of the utility's liability. </p>

            <p>Dumas later clarified that every party has negotiated with the expectation that PG&amp;E will not be found liable for the Tubbs Fire, that there's no value attributed to personal injury and that other uninsured losses have no value. </p>

            <p>&quot;For the purposes of other parties coming in to give you choice and competition, they are echoing the debtors' position,&quot; she said. </p>

            <p>Wild re claimants are &quot;not optimistic that simply lifting exclusivity will solve the problem of the intractable gulf&quot; between the positions staked out by the negotiating parties, Dumas concluded. </p>

            <p>Montali will consider whether to establish a wild re claims estimation procedure at an Aug. 14 hearing. </p>

            <p>A group of insurers also argued to terminate PG&amp;E's exclusivity to allow consideration of its proposal but received less consideration because no party supported its position. </p>

            <h5>Despite trial losses, Bayer may find success at the US Supreme Court</h5>
            <p>Bayer AG, which owns Monsanto, has consistently maintained the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s position that its Roundup weed killer should bar lawsuits against it, and a recent agency decision may bolster that argument. </p>

            <p>Bayer AG has adamantly maintained the Environmental Protection Agency's position that the company's Roundup weed killer does not cause cancer should bar more than 18,000 lawsuits over accusations alleging the opposite. </p>

            <p>Three trial judges have rejected Monsanto's defense, but a more business-friendly U.S. Supreme Court may be &quot;more receptive&quot; to the argument, according to legal experts. </p>

            <p>Despite a prior ruling that federal directives do not preclude plaintiffs from pursuing state law claims, University of Florida Law Professor Lars Noah said the high court has &quot;swung back,&quot; giving Bayer &quot;good reason to feel pretty con dent that they can beat the rap.&quot; </p>

            <p>The EPA issued a statement last week to Roundup registrants that it found the herbicide's active ingredient, glyphosate, to be safe. It also clarified that the agency will no longer approve labels claiming the chemical causes cancer because it is a &quot;false claim&quot; and &quot;misinforms the public about the risks they are facing.&quot; </p>

            <p>The unprompted statement sets the stage for a potentially precedent-setting ruling if the high court takes the case for review on &quot;this tremendous tension between greater intrusiveness by private litigation on judgments about federally licensed products and activities,&quot; Noah said. </p>

            <p>Judges in the three Roundup trials dismissed Monsanto's pre-emption defense, citing a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the EPA's approval does not preclude liability. </p>

            <p>Defense attorneys have consistently argued that various trial judges should not have permitted claims that Monsanto should have included a warning label on weed killers containing glyphosate since the EPA does not require one and would have rejected a request to add it had the company asked. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco, who oversees the consolidated lawsuits in federal court, disagreed. Monsanto's position is &quot;difficult -- if not impossible -- to square with&quot; high court precedent that state claims are not barred by federal statutes, Chhabria wrote. <span class="ital">Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.S. 431 (2005).</span> </p>

            <p>Loyola School of Law Professor Adam Zimmerman said the decision &quot;provides a lot of breathing space for state law to supplement the way we regulate the safety of products.&quot; </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs' attorney R. Brent Wisner, who most recently represented Alva and Alberta Pilliod in the Alameda County Superior Court trial, called Bayer's interpretation of federal pre-emption a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; that has been &quot;systematically rejected&quot; by various courts. <span class="ital">Pilliod v. Monsanto Co.</span> , RG17862702 (Alameda Super. Ct., led Nov. 16, 2017). </p>

            <p>But Noah said Bayer's defense is &quot;fairly powerful, not because of existing decisional law, but because of the drift in the way the U.S. Supreme Court has been dealing with pre-emption defense.&quot; He called the <span class="ital">Bates</span> decision, which is the most relevant to the Roundup litigation, an &quot;outlier.&quot; </p>

            <p>According to the public health law professor, the high court has consistently defended pre-emption since <span class="ital">Bates</span> , indicating a desire to curb lawsuits in which companies are sued because of opinions from federal regulatory agencies. </p>

            <p>Bayer has argued on appeal that <span class="ital">Bates</span> is no longer the controlling ruling on the matter. </p>

            <p>&quot;During [then-President George W.] Bush's administration, a bunch of federal agencies started announcing 'We think our rules pre-empt tort claims,'&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Noah added that the EPA is trying to tell the courts its decisions &quot;need to be taken seriously.&quot; </p>

            <p>Ruling on a similar case in which Merck &amp; Co. argued it could not have changed the warning label on its allegedly hazardous drug because the Food and Drug Administration would not have let it, the high court reversed an appellate court and ruled that the company is entitled to a pre-emption defense, sending the lawsuit back to lower courts. </p>

            <p>Although that decision is not directly applicable to the Roundup litigation, according to Noah, it bodes well for Monsanto's defense if its case is accepted for review. </p>

            <p>A Bayer spokesperson did not return requests for comment.</p>

            <p>The federal judge overseeing allegations that Facebook Inc. illegally shared vast amounts of users&rsquo; personal information considered Wednesday if people could reasonably understand that they agreed to let the company sell private data to third parties. </p>

            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- A U.S. judge overseeing allegations Facebook Inc. illegally shared vast amounts of users' personal information considered Wednesday if people could reasonably understand that they agreed to let the company sell private data to third parties. </p>

            <p>An attorney for the social media giant argued Facebook not only &quot;bluntly and repeatedly&quot; alerted users to the practice but also informed them there is &quot;no reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; to information they share on the platform. </p>

            <p>&quot;When you share that information, you lose control over it and the subsequent disclosure,&quot; Orin Snyder, a partner with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, said at the hearing on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. &quot;It authorizes the recipient to share with the world.&quot;  The proposed class action brought by plaintiffs across dozens of states concern alleged privacy violations, including a claim that third parties obtained the personal information of users' friends without their express permission. </p>

            <p>It was led shortly after the revelation in March 2018 that political consulting rm Cambridge Analytica unlawfully obtained 87 million users' private data through a Facebook application. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of the Northern District said the standard on whether to dismiss the lawsuit is how a reasonable Facebook user in 2012 would interpret the disclosure that the company shares personal information with third parties. </p>

            <p>The judge did not rule on Facebook's motion to dismiss the case Wednesday. </p>

            <p>There are more than 25 lawsuits consolidated in the multi-district litigation seeking billions of dollars in damages. <span class="ital">In re: Facebook Inc. Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, 18-MD02843 (N.D. Cal., led June 6, 2018).</span> </p>

            <p>After clarifying the &quot;complaint is not whether Facebook said anything misleading but that the disclosures should have been more prominent and clear&quot; at a February hearing, the judge asked Snyder to assume Facebook sold a user's private data despite a written assurance by the company that it would not do so. </p>

            <p>&quot;Is that a serious privacy invasion by Facebook?&quot; Chhabria asked. </p>

            <p>The user &quot;has no expectation to privacy over the information she shares on social media,&quot; Snyder responded, adding Facebook's &quot;layered disclosures&quot; fully brief users on the practice. Chhabria shot back: &quot;What you're saying seems contrary to the message Facebook sends about privacy. If we asked the CEO about it, if he were standing here, would he be saying the same thing?&quot; </p>

            <p>The judge added Facebook's disclosure on the matter is &quot;misleading,&quot; especially because data sharing was a relatively unknown concept at the time of the alleged misconduct. He conceded Facebook's &quot;interpretation is probably the best interpretation for an extremely well informed person,&quot; but he is unsure whether a reasonable user could conclude the same.  Snyder said the plaintiffs never substantiated any harm as a result of the practice, and users could restrict what information is shared. </p>

            <p>&quot;Plaintiffs don't like it, but there's no statute that makes it illegal for social media to share information that users voluntarily share with friends in circumstances they were told that once you share, you lose control,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Chhabria then grilled plaintiffs' attorney Derek W. Loeser of Keller Rohrback LLP on whether there are multiple ways a user could legitimately interpret Facebook's disclosure. </p>

            <p>Loeser responded there is clearly a dispute because Facebook &quot;has an interpretation of these documents, and we have a different interpretation.&quot; </p>

            <p>Chhabria said it &quot;depends on how plausible your interpretation is,&quot; adding contractual disputes, which the judge made clear this case partially is about, are typically decided by judges and not juries. </p>

            <p>The conversation next turned to allegations Facebook did nothing to limit unlawful access to data by third parties. He asked multiple times whether plaintiffs' attorneys are arguing in their complaint that the company never made rules or that it simply never enforced them. </p>

            <p>After multiple tries at answering the question, to which Chhabria grew increasingly frustrated, Loeser said there was a &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; data would not be shared with third parties if users did not consent. </p>

            <p>Lesley Weaver of Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP rested the plaintiffs' case after trying to prove economic harm, which Chhabria said they have &quot;one more shot at&quot; in an order issued before the hearing Tuesday evening. She argued Facebook violated the intellectual property rights to users' photos and videos when the company shared them with third parties. </p>

            <p>Chhabria appeared skeptical. </p>

            <h5>Prominent attorney who resolves tough cases has challenges in settling Monsanto lawsuit</h5>
            <p>Legal observers praise attorney Kenneth R. Feinberg as &ldquo;the perfect guy&rdquo; to mediate settlement discussions in litigation between plaintiffs suing Bayer AG- owned Monsanto saying its weed killers cause cancer. But they also say it will be difficult to settle.   Courts across the nation call on Kenneth R. Feinberg to resolve seemingly unresolvable cases. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco did the same last week when he tapped the Washington, D.C.-based attorney to mediate settlement discussions in roughly 900 lawsuits alleging Monsanto's Roundup weed killer causes cancer.  Kenneth R. Feinberg </p>

            <p>Several legal observers called Feinberg the ideal person for the job. He has facilitated settlements in complex, high-profile cases such as the Sept. 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Volkswagen AG's diesel emissions scandal. </p>

            <p>But statements following the most recent state court verdict in May suggest he will have a substantial gap to bridge between the two sides. </p>

            <p>&quot;[He] obviously has a lot of experience in this realm, but I'd be surprised to see a settlement anytime soon,&quot; said University of Georgia School of Law professor Elizabeth C. Burch. </p>

            <p>The company has maintained domestic and international regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, continue to find no adverse health effects associated with Roundup exposure. </p>

            <p>While settlements may be unlikely, agreed UC Hastings School of Law professor David Levine, a combination of Feinberg's resolutions of the Agent Orange product liability lawsuits and asbestos litigation may serve as a replicable template. </p>

            <p>More than 13,400 plaintiffs across the country have alleged exposure to Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lyphoma. In re: Roundup Liability Litigation, 16-MD02741 (N.D. Cal., led Oct. 4, 2016); <span class="ital">Pilliod v. Monsanto Co.</span> , RG17862702 (Alameda Super. Ct., led Nov. 16, 2017). </p>

            <p>The resolution of the Agent Orange lawsuits, in which Vietnam War veterans and their families alleged injury from exposure to chemical herbicides, created a $180 million settlement fund. The program was unique in that the eligible plaintiffs did not have to prove causation between exposure to the chemical and their condition in exchange for surrendering compensation proportionate to their injuries. </p>

            <p>&quot;Proving exposure to Roundup caused your cancer, that's going to be the hardest part,&quot; Levine said. </p>

            <p>The incentive for plaintiffs to settle for a smaller award is the certainty of a payout on specific causation claims that are difficult to prove considering non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a common and typically idiopathic cancer, he said. </p>

            <p>But the Agent Orange settlement did not provide payment to plaintiffs who developed an illness after the eligibility period, which was common because conditions associated to Agent Orange exposure, like Roundup exposure, take decades to develop. </p>

            <p>Although the &quot;claims procedure did not work as well&quot; in the asbestos litigation, Levine added, it created a trust in which claimants not yet diagnosed with an illness at the time of the settlement could receive a payout. </p>

            <p>Among the most difficult aspects of reaching a settlement in the Monsanto cases, like the asbestos lawsuits, will be determining the different classes of plaintiffs, according to Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Andrew Pollis.  Attorneys may want to ensure a process in which people who have been exposed to Roundup and are concerned about their increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma can receive a settlement proportionate to their injuries if they develop cancer down the road. </p>

            <p>&quot;That's something I would look for as a plaintiffs' attorney,&quot; Pollis said. &quot;For those people to then be transferred into a different class of claimants.&quot; </p>

            <p>Still, legal observers were skeptical about the chances of a settlement in the near future because Monsanto is coming to the table at a point in litigation when the plaintiffs have the most leverage after three jury verdicts against the company in the last year. </p>

            <p>&quot;As this litigation is still in the early stages -- with no cases that have run their course through appeal -- we will also remain focused on defending the safety of glyphosate- based herbicides in court,&quot; said Bayer spokesperson Charla Lord in a statement.  Meanwhile, plaintiffs' attorneys have been encouraged by the massive awards totaling more than $2 billion. </p>

            <p>The attorneys who have prevailed in the trials and continue to represent thousands of plaintiffs expressed that they want to continue trying the cases before juries. </p>

            <p>R. Brent Wisner, who was lead attorney in two state court trials against Monsanto said: &quot;At this point, I don't know if we would settle.&quot; Aimee H. Wagstaff, the lead attorney in the first federal Monsanto trial, said, &quot;there's no signal to suggest that we won't continue to have great success at the trial courts.&quot; </p>

            <p>But if there is anyone up to the task, it appears Feinberg has the best shot, legal observers agreed. </p>

            <p>&quot;He's the perfect guy to do it,&quot; Levine said. </p>

            <p>Feinberg declined to comment on Friday. </p>

            <h5>Trump’s emergency wall declaration faces first legal test</h5>
            <p>The Trump administration's emergency declaration to build a border wall faced its first test Friday as attorneys for 20 states and public interest groups urged a federal judge to temporarily block the project. </p>

            <p>OAKLAND -- The Trump administration's emergency declaration to build a border wall faced its first test Friday as attorneys for 20 states and public interest groups urged a federal judge to temporarily block the project. </p>

            <p>The president exceeded the scope of his authority and disregarded the interests of Congress by diverting more than $6 billion to fund the proposed thousand-mile wall along the Southern border of Mexico, said a lawyer for the House of Representatives.  &quot;No money may be spent unless Congress actually appropriates it,&quot; Douglas Letter told U.S. District Judge  Haywood Gilliam Jr.    Plaintiffs had to prove the building of and additional financing efforts for the wall would cause irreparable harm to warrant halting construction while the case is decided. The government has maintained the president has the discretionary authority to redirect federal funds for purposes such as &quot;law enforcement activity&quot; and &quot;unforeseen military&quot; priorities. </p>

            <p>Congress approved in February $1.37 billion for construction of a border in Texas. Trump then declared a national emergency to divert $3.6 billion from military construction efforts, $2.5 billion from Department of Defense counter narcotics programs and $601 million from the treasury forfeiture fund to finance additional walls in Arizona and New Mexico. </p>

            <p>The plaintiffs' argument was two-pronged: The diversion of federal funds violates Congress' authority and the construction of the wall itself would harm surrounding communities. </p>

            <p>The Department of Defense is unlawfully redirecting the $2.5 billion meant for counter narcotics programs, which are intended for road lighting and fencing, to build the wall, said plaintiffs' attorney Dror Ladin for the Southern Border Communities Coalition. Congress restricted the building of the wall to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and never authorized construction elsewhere, Ladin said. </p>

            <p>The wall would also affect the use and enjoyment of public land, which higher courts have recognized as enough to grant a preliminary injunction, in addition to harming &quot;New Mexico's sovereign interest in managing wildlife and natural resources,&quot; said Janelle Smith for the California Attorney General's Office. </p>

            <p>The president has said the wall is needed to address a crisis of criminals and drugs coming over the border. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs include 20 states, the Sierra Club and the Southern Borders Communities Coalition. They argued a &quot;flagrant disregard of fundamental separation of powers principles,&quot; among other claims, according to court lings. <span class="ital">California v. Trump, 19- CV00872 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 18, 2019).</span> </p>

            <p>Up last for the plaintiffs was California Department of Justice attorney Lee Sherman, who argued the diversion of treasury forfeiture funds would undermine state law enforcement and public safety. </p>

            <p>Gilliam said he understands the case is &quot;founded on what defendants are doing exceeds what Congress authorized,&quot; but that there needs to be an answer as to where he can make a finding of irreparable harm. </p>

            <p>Sherman said the treasury forfeiture fund, which states are entitled to a piece of, will be &quot;underwater&quot; by the end of the year if construction of the wall is allowed to proceed. Construction in New Mexico is slated to begin next week, and the government has already indicated it plans to divert treasury forfeiture funds as early as next month, he added. </p>

            <p>U.S. Department of Justice attorney James Burnham dismissed Sherman's argument because the fund is a &quot;pot of money states never have access to.&quot; They only have a partial stake in funds seized in coordinated law enforcement efforts, he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;Their theory is if it were to entirely implode, whether entitled to it or not, then they wouldn't get paid,&quot; Gilliam said. </p>

            <p>Burnham responded the &quot;fund won't disappear&quot; since there is roughly $500 million set aside for next year. </p>

            <p>The government attorney next turned to allegations the president unlawfully diverted money that was not approved by Congress, arguing the Department of Justice has the discretionary authority to construct border barriers. </p>

            <p>Addressing the use of money earmarked for counter narcotics programs, Burnham conceded the administration was not planning to use those funds but said Congress never restricted the diversion. </p>

            <p>He also assured the court &quot;no construction would start until at least 45 days until today.&quot;  </p>

            <h5>Bayer attorneys want appellate rulings as they challenge weedkiller verdicts</h5>
            <p>Attorneys on both sides of the landmark Monsanto weedkiller litigation indicated they are not willing to settle after three multimillion verdicts against the Bayer-AG owned company. </p>

            <p>Attorneys on both sides of the landmark Monsanto weedkiller litigation indicated they are not willing to settle after three multimillion-dollar verdicts against the Bayer-AG owned company. </p>

            <p>Bayer's attorneys said in a media briefing Wednesday they will wait before seriously engaging in settlement discussions because they are optimistic they will prevail on key appellate issues such as allowing state claims that should have been prohibited and what they described as &quot;shaky&quot; expert testimony. </p>

            <p>&quot;It's important in litigation like this to assess cases over the long term and go through some of those key steps -- get some appellate guidance on some issues,&quot; said Bayer national strategy lead William Hoffman of Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP. &quot;Those are critical factors for any kind of assessment.&quot; </p>

            <p>The attorneys who have prevailed in the three jury trials against Monsanto and continue to represent thousands of plaintiffs responded that they want to try their cases. </p>

            <p>&quot;They've never been willing or interested in settling,&quot; said R. Brent Wisner, who was lead attorney in two state court trials against Monsanto on accusations that its weedkiller causes cancer. &quot;Frankly, at this point, I don't know if we would settle.&quot; </p>

            <p>Aimee H. Wagstaff, who was the lead attorney in the first federal Monsanto trial that concluded in March, said, &quot;There's no signal to suggest that we won't continue to have great success at the trial courts.&quot; </p>

            <p>Both sides said they will approach settlement discussions in good faith and ultimately do what is best for their clients.  Bayer attorneys emphasized that various trial judges should not have allowed claims arguing that Monsanto should have included a warning label on weedkillers containing glyphosate, Roundup's active ingredient. </p>

            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency does not require a warning and would have rejected a request to add one if Monsanto had asked, according to defense attorney Eric G. Lasker. </p>

            <p>&quot;Before a warning is required, that risk has to be generally accepted in the scienti c community,&quot; the Hollingsworth LLP partner said. &quot;The regulatory evidence that has come in thus far directly undercuts any argument in that regard.&quot; U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who oversees the consolidated federal litigation, agreed with the plaintiffs' attorneys in March, ruling, &quot;Monsanto's argument reflects a misreading of the statute&quot; in an order rejecting the company's motion to dismiss the case.  Monsanto's position is &quot;difficult -- if not impossible -- to square with&quot; Supreme Court precedent that state claims for defective designs are not barred by federal statutes, Chhabria wrote. <span class="ital">Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC (2005).</span> </p>

            <p>Wisner called Bayer's interpretation of federal pre-emption on the failure to warn claims a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; that has been &quot;systematically rejected&quot; by various courts. </p>

            <p>Loyola School of Law Professor Adam Zimmerman agreed with Chhabria's interpretation of the issue. He added that Bayer's best chance on appeal is challenging judges' decisions to allow some of the plaintiffs' expert testimony. </p>

            <p>Bayer attorney Lee Marshall called the testimony by pathologist Dennis Weisenburger, who opined on issues of specific causation, a &quot;significant issue on appeal.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;In essence, these experts are concluding that no matter the medical history or risk factors, that somehow Roundup is always the cause of the disease, even when the majority of the causes are unknown,&quot; said the Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP partner. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs in each of the three trials had medical conditions associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which the defense argued were the most likely causes of their cancers. </p>

            <p>Other issues Hoffman highlighted included Alameda County Superior Court Judge Winifred Y. Smith denying Bayer's request to split the trial into two phases on causation and then misconduct, the prohibition of evidence that the EPA reaffirmed its position that glyphosate does not cause cancer and whether punitive damages should even be allowed given the &quot;scientific and regulatory record that existed at the time.&quot; </p>

            <p>Wagstaff shot back that plaintiffs' attorneys were barred from presenting the majority of evidence they wanted to introduce.  &quot;We probably got in 30 percent of the evidence,&quot; she said. &quot;There are some story lines that have never made it into any trial yet. There's a lot more to come.&quot; </p>

            <p>An Alameda County jury most recently hit Bayer with a $2.055 billion verdict on Monday after a Northern District federal jury awarded more than $80 million to a 70- year-old man who also argued exposure to Monsanto's weedkillers caused his non- Hodgkin lymphoma. Pilliod v. Monsanto Co., RG17862702 (Alameda Super. Ct., led Nov. 16, 2017). </p>

            <p>Both trials were the first in a series of test cases in consolidated state and federal court litigation. <span class="ital">In re Roundup Products Liability Litigation</span>, 16-MD02741 (N.D. Cal., led Oct. 4, 2016). </p>

            <p>A San Francisco County jury, in the first trial against Bayer last August, also awarded a dying groundskeeper $289 million, which was later reduced to $78 million by the trial judge. <span class="ital">Johnson v. Monsanto Co.</span>, CGC-16-550128 (San Francisco Sup. Ct., led Jan. 28, 2016). </p>

            <h5>San Francisco-area judges, appellate courts skeptical of artificial intelligence patents</h5>
            <p>While major technology giants and smaller companies are acquiring patents on artificial intelligence technology at a rapid clip, judges in the San Francisco Bay Area and federal appellate courts are rejecting claims of ownership to overbroad applications of those patents. </p>

            <p>While major technology giants and smaller companies are acquiring patents on artificial intelligence technology at a rapid clip, judges are rejecting claims of ownership to applications that appear to be overly broad. </p>

            <p>Courts have largely dismissed patentee allegations of infringement, concluding the allegedly stolen ideas are unenforceable abstract concepts. </p>

            <p>&quot;Every single industry uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to function better,&quot; said George Simion, senior director of intellectual property at Palo Alto Networks. &quot;The courts are changing to do a better job in invalidating those patents.&quot; </p>

            <p>A Northern District federal judge offered rare insight into the enforceability of artificial intelligence patents when he issued a closely- watched ruling in a dispute between two technology companies, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November. <span class="ital">PurePredictive Inc. v. H20.AI, Inc.</span> , 17-CV03049 (N.D. Cal., led May 26, 2017). </p>

            <p>PurePredictive Inc. is a software company that sells a machine learning platform for predictive analytics. It sued H2O.ai Inc., another technology company that offers similar services, arguing one of its products -- which automatically generates an &quot;ensemble&quot; of machine learning models -- infringed its technology. </p>

            <p>H20.ai, in a motion to dismiss, argued PurePredictive's claims do not satisfy the more stringent patent eligibility criteria set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2014 ruling. <span class="ital">Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International</span>, 573 U.S. 208, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). </p>

            <p>The Mountain View-based defendant company argued the plaintiff's claims were directed to an abstract mathematical process for testing algorithms. </p>

            <p>Clement S. Roberts, a partner with Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP who represents H20.ai, characterized the patent as &quot;an attempt to monopolize the use of basic mathematical manipulations without reference to any specific implementation, application, purpose, or use.&quot; </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge of San Francisco agreed with H20.ai and dismissed the allegations. He found &quot;that this process is merely the running of data through a machine,&quot; and the claims &quot;go to the general abstract concept of predictive analytics rather than any specific application.&quot; </p>

            <p>Orrick concluded different providers writing different code might end up with identical results, according to Ron Yearwood, senior managing director at FTI Consulting Inc.. </p>

            <p>&quot;There are only so many different ways to write an algebraic equation,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>In a similar case before Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District, Voip-Pal.com argued Apple Inc., AT&amp;T Corp., Twitter Inc. and Verizon Wireless Services LLC infringed its patented method of delivering phone calls and text messages. The allegations related to the software company's computerized system of diverting telephone calls through various networks using information relevant to the callers. Koh found the patents invalid in March, concluding they were too general and abstract under the Alice test because they covered subject matter that could be performed by people. <span class="ital">Voip-Pal.com v. Apple Inc.</span>, 18-CV06217 (N.D. Cal., led Oct. 11, 2018). </p>

            <p>While asserting the rights to these &quot;land grabbing&quot; patents, as Quantstamp Inc. Vice President Olga V. Mack put it, were in vogue years ago, legal experts said it is much harder to do so now.   Amid confusion and frustration by federal judges on how to apply the Alice test, courts have leaned toward invalidating patents that could be interpreted as claiming ownership to a concept rather than a practical and specific application of that idea, according to McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert &amp; Berghoff LLP partner Michael S. Borella. </p>

            <p>&quot;At the end of the day, artificial intelligence is just math,&quot; he said. &quot;It's sophisticated math, but that's what it is.&quot; </p>

            <p>While courts are not currently recognizing ownership to overly-broad artificial intelligence-related concepts in patent disputes, some legal experts are concerned large technology companies will slow innovation through litigation if courts start to find in favor of patentees. </p>

            <p>The United Nations Intellectual Property Organization noted in January a rapid uptick in artificial intelligence patent applications. More than half of the 340,000 artificial intelligence-related patents have been awarded since 2013 with Mountain View-based Alphabet Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. leading the pack. </p>

            <p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office certified 1,400 artificial intelligence-related patents to IBM in 2017 alone.   Simion said he has noticed &quot;a large mass of patents being led by large companies trying to assert certain positions in the field.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Companies are coming up with very generic stuff in the hope that courts will apply it to whatever develops from now,&quot; Mack said. &quot;It's a result of uncertainty.&quot; </p>

            <p>Alphabet has maintained it holds patents defensively and not with the intent to start legal disputes while IBM has stated the company's patent portfolio reflects its investment in fundamental research. </p>

            <p>Still, the issue has legal observers anxious as companies in nascent industries are fighting to establish standards which could concern millions of dollars in intellectual property down the road. </p>

            <p>&quot;One way to make sure you have longevity is to create amazing technology, but another way is to create a standard everyone follows,&quot; Mack said. &quot;I'm not sure how good those battles are as to outcomes in society.&quot;  </p>

            <h5>Judge hears arguments seeking to block proposed federal rules on health clinics</h5>
            <p>Attorneys seeking to maintain California&rsquo;s federal funding for family and reproductive health care services warned a judge Thursday of an &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; of clinics and providers that administer those services if he does not halt the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts to curtail abortion programs. </p>

            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Attorneys seeking to maintain California's federal funding for family and reproductive health care services warned a judge Thursday of an &quot;exodus&quot; of clinics and providers that administer those services if he does not halt the Trump administration's efforts to curtail abortion programs. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco appeared hesitant to risk the access to &quot;potentially lifesaving health care,&quot; as one plaintiffs' attorney put it, by more than a million, mostly low-income Californians. </p>

            <p>He seemed unconvinced by U.S. Department of Justice assertions that competitors will take the place of health care providers who said they would not be able to continue to operate without the Title X funding. </p>

            <p>&quot;Just because the final rule doesn't cut people off, it imposes burdens, which some people perceive as ineffective or impeding the ability of medical professionals to carry out what they think is an ethical duty,&quot; said Chen, who did not rule on the state's bid for a preliminary injunction. </p>

            <p>The legal dispute concerns what constitutes &quot;nondirective counseling&quot; under Title X, a $286 million federal family planning initiative. Programs that get the funding provide a range of services from preventative breast and cervical cancer screenings to treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

            <p>It was already prohibited for the providers to use the funds for abortions, but the newly implemented rules announced last year also bar providing referrals for abortion services. </p>

            <p>The judge first asked plaintiffs' attorneys of the most substantial harm that would be incurred if the changes to Title X funding were implemented. </p>

            <p>Planned Parenthood, which accounts for 40 percent of the 4,000 clinics nationwide that receiving the federal funding, already stated it would no longer be eligible, according to Michelle Ybarra of Keker, Van Nest &amp; Peters LLP. She said 650 Planned Parenthood associates would be forced to exit the program. </p>

            <p>Reproductive and sexual health care outreach and education would also be curbed, which would &quot;directly lead to unexpected and mistimed pregnancies&quot; and &quot;serious complications with childbirth,&quot; continued plaintiffs' attorney Anna Rich of the state Department of Justice. </p>

            <p>&quot;The complications that will arise with fewer access will end up harming the public,&quot; she said, adding the additional costs will most likely be incurred by the state's Medicaid program in the millions of dollars. </p>

            <p>Defense attorney James Burnham of the U.S. Department of Justice shot back that the changes to Title X does not directly cut off funding for any organization. He said the state and other plaintiffs have offered no concrete evidence of irreparable harm since most programs will most likely rather comply than lose the funding. </p>

            <p>&quot;Only one program has said they will leave rather than comply,&quot; he said. &quot;Anyway, new providers will emerge in compliance with Title X funding.&quot; </p>

            <p>Chen was skeptical. </p>

            <p>&quot;In many rural parts of California, it's tough to find licensed professionals for miles and miles that are able to serve non-English speaking populations,&quot; the judge said. &quot;It's not easy for people to step in.&quot; </p>

            <p>Burnham responded that plaintiffs' attorneys have not offered evidence on the matter, which Ybarra contested by pointing to the multiple friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by interested parties expressing concern over having to close if the funding were cut.   The new federal regulations will take effect May 3 unless Chen issues a temporary injunction. <span class="ital">California v. Alex Azar</span>, 19-CV01184 (N.D. Cal., led March 4, 2018). Essential Access Health Inc., which operates an umbrella of programs providing reproductive health care and received $20.5 million in Title X funding, is a named plaintiff in the case. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs' attorneys argued &quot;nondirective counseling&quot; includes referrals for abortion so long as a comprehensive portrait of options is presented to the patient, while Burnham has maintained there is a &quot;fundamental difference between counsel and referral.&quot; </p>

            <p>The state Department of Justice also alleged procedural and constitutional violations to how Title X funding was amended.  </p>

            <h5>Judge's order leaves fate of some asylum seekers uncertain</h5>
            <p>Some asylum seekers already sent back to Mexico face an uncertain future despite a San Francisco federal judge&rsquo;s order to halt a Trump administration policy. </p>

            <p>Despite a San Francisco federal judge's order to halt the Trump administration's policy of requiring some asylum seekers to return to Mexico as they await court hearings, the fate of those already sent back &quot;remains to be worked out,&quot; according to an American Civil Liberties Union attorney on the case. </p>

            <p>While allowing the 11 named plaintiffs to re-enter the United States starting Sunday, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg did not address recourse for over a thousand Central Americans seeking asylum who were told to stay in Mexico while their cases are pending. </p>

            <p>&quot;We're still figuring out details for folks who have been returned and will come back for scheduled hearings,&quot; said ACLU attorney Julie Veroff on Tuesday. </p>

            <p>The judge found the Department of Homeland Security did not have the authority and did not follow proper procedures to implement the Migrant Protections Protocol policy. The preliminary, nationwide injunction will take effect on Friday to allow for the possibility of a stay by higher courts, according to the order. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs' attorney Blaine Bookey of the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies said the recourse for asylum seekers already sent back to Mexico remains &quot;up in the air&quot; because they are at various stages in the application process. </p>

            <p>But Kevin Johnson, dean of the UC Davis School of Law and an immigration law expert, said asylum seekers sent back to Mexico pursuant the policy can theoretically return after the injunction takes effect and be allowed to stay in the United States while their cases are pending. </p>

            <p>&quot;The judge didn't want to invite them all to come back at once, but there's a window if they so want,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>&quot;The statute DHS contends the MPP is designed to enforce does not apply to these circumstances, and even if it did, further procedural protections would be required to conform to the government's acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances,&quot; Seeborg wrote in his Monday order. </p>

            <p>The DHS has maintained there are a record number of families seeking &quot;to exploit the loopholes in our immigration system&quot; and denounced the courts' refusal to &quot;provide a remedy to the current crisis on the Southern Border,&quot; according to a statement from DHS spokesperson Andrea Palermo.   &quot;The court's decision ignores the Secretary's clear statutory authority to return aliens arriving on land from Mexico pending removal proceedings, as well as the Secretary's broad discretionary authority over whether to bring removal proceedings against inadmissible and unlawfully present aliens, and what type of proceeding to bring,&quot; the statement continued. </p>

            <p>The Department of Justice declined to comment on the policy ordering some non- Mexican asylum seekers, namely Central Americans fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to wait in Mexico while their immigration cases work their way through a backlogged court system. <span class="ital">Innovation Law Lab v. Kirstjen Nielsen</span>, 19- CV00907 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 14, 2019).  Plaintiffs' attorneys argued the policy failed to comply with procedural notice and comment requirements, and the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits removal to any jurisdiction where a person could be in danger of persecution. </p>

            <p>The government countered that courts do not have the authority to review what the DHS called &quot;prosecutorial discretion&quot; concerning the policy. </p>

            <p>Seeborg disagreed and wrote &quot;even assuming the statute could or should be applied to the individual plaintiffs, they have met their burden to enjoin the MPP on grounds that it lacks sufficient protections against aliens being returned to places where they face undue risk to their lives or freedom.&quot; </p>

            <h5>Trump executive order on campus free speech draws mixed response</h5>
            <p>Legal observers and higher education groups decried an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump tying federal funding to universities enforcing &ldquo;free and open debate&rdquo; as &ldquo;micromanaging&rdquo; campus free speech and being unnecessarily burdensome. </p>

            <p>Some legal observers and higher education groups decried an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump tying federal funding to universities enforcing &quot;free and open debate&quot; as &quot;micromanaging&quot; campus free speech and being unnecessarily burdensome. </p>

            <p>Others were relieved the order does not assert new obligations and is simply ensuring that universities are following the status quo. </p>

            <p>Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Dhillon Law Group Inc., whose rm has sued UC Berkeley over its treatment of conservative speakers, said the order is &quot;long overdue.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Universities are subject to regulation if they want to get federal funding,&quot; she said. &quot;It's entirely appropriate this norm be applied.&quot; </p>

            <p>The order directs federal agencies, including the departments of defense, education and labor, to enforce existing &quot;stated institutional policies&quot; on freedom of speech. It instructs the agencies to certify that universities receiving federal research funding are complying with U.S. law and regulations. </p>

            <p>&quot;Free inquiry is an essential feature of this nation's democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity,&quot; the order reads. &quot;We must encourage institutions to appropriately account for this bedrock principle in their administration of student life and to avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.&quot; </p>

            <p>But the American Council on Education and Association of American Universities both called the order a &quot;solution in search of a problem.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;No matter how this order is implemented, it is neither needed nor desirable, and could lead to unwanted federal micromanagement of the cutting-edge research that is critical to our nation's continued vitality and global leadership,&quot; the statement reads. </p>

            <p>The directive does not outline enforcement, which John M. Hamasaki said indicates the order is more &quot;political than substantive&quot; and, therefore, unnecessary. </p>

            <p>Hamasaki was a lead attorney defending UC Berkeley against claims it exposed members of the Berkeley College Republicans, who were hosting a 2017 event for conservative speaker Milo Yiannopolous, to violent anarchists. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken, in an order last week, dismissed the claims against UC Berkeley but allowed the suit to move forward against two university police officers for their actions in a riot that led to the cancellation of Yiannopolous' speech. <span class="ital">Jennings et al. v. Regents et al.</span>, 18-CV00268 (N.D. Cal., led Jan. 11, 2018). &quot;Even though it may not appear substantive at first glance, it's certainly concerning -- the idea that the federal government is essentially micromanaging what is free speech,&quot; Hamasaki said. </p>

            <p>UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said in an email the university &quot;welcomes scrutiny of its words and deeds in support of free speech and diversity of perspective&quot; and that its &quot;commitment to the First Amendment is unwavering.&quot; </p>

            <p>Dhillon settled a free speech lawsuit against UC Berkeley in December over allegations the university discriminated against conservative speakers. It agreed to modify its policy for handling major events, agreeing not to charge fees or relocate speeches based on the speaker's viewpoint. UC Berkeley's actions &quot;absolutely violated the First Amendment,&quot; Dhillon said, adding she is aware of several other public universities that get millions of dollars in federal funding, including UC Santa Cruz and the University of Minnesota, where they &quot;discriminate and block certain speakers from coming.&quot; </p>

            <p>Princeton University professor Keith Whittington, who specializes in constitutional theory, said he was relieved the order does not &quot;assert new obligations&quot; but added universities may be burdened by trying to update their policies because it does not outline &quot;legal obligations&quot; for free speech. </p>

            <p>&quot;The order doesn't seem to do very much,&quot; he said. &quot;The actual operation is relatively minimal, but it remains to be seen how it works in practice.&quot; </p>

            <p>The authority to revoke federal funding over free speech may not be vested in the executive branch but in Congress, Whittington continued. </p>

            <p>&quot;It's not at all obvious that they have legal authority to do so,&quot; he said. &quot;I just don't know about the statutes they're thinking about to know whether the administration is overreaching as they've done in the past, or if they're on rm legal footing.&quot; </p>

            <p>Dhillon disagreed and said it is absolutely within the president's authority to revoke funding if universities are not enforcing federal free speech policies.</p>

            <h5>NCAA ruling unlikely the watershed advocates hoped</h5>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- The federal judge overseeing student-athletes' most recent bid for a pay-for-play compensation model took a sympathetic view of their case but was limited to findings by higher courts more supportive of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's position on amateurism, several legal observers said. </p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken of Oakland was careful in her 104-page ruling last week to sidestep the &quot;quantum leap&quot; the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals used to describe her previous remedy that was overturned in a similar antitrust suit against the NCAA. <span class="ital">In re: National Collegiate Athletic Association Athletic Grant-in-Aid Cap Antitrust Litigation</span>, 14-MD02541 (N.D. Cal., led June 13, 2014). </p>

            <p>&quot;[The 9th Circuit opinion] was illogical, and Wilken here is straining to stay within it,&quot; said William Gould, a professor at Stanford Law School. </p>

            <p>The NCAA and its associated conferences have until February 2020 to determine what qualifies as a benefit related to education under the newly-added benefits and comply with the judge's remedy. </p>

            <p>In a 2015 case over student-athletes challenging the NCAA's rules prohibiting them from being paid for use of their names, images and likeness, Wilken found an antitrust violation and went so far as increasing scholarship money to the full cost of attendance in addition to allowing schools to provide players with up to $5,000 in deferred compensation per year. </p>

            <p>While maintaining Wilken's antitrust finding, the 9th Circuit said there is a massive difference between reimbursing college athletes for educational expenses and giving them money for use of their likeness. The cash payment was overturned. </p>

            <p>&quot;In light of ... the Supreme Court's admonition that we must afford the NCAA 'ample latitude' to superintend college athletics, we think it is clear the district court erred,&quot; wrote 9th Circuit Judge Jay Bybee. While many observers hoped this case would be a watershed moment for student- athletes claiming a larger stake in the multi-billion dollar industry, the &quot;NCAA and those who represent athletes will come together to nd some middle ground&quot; at some point, according to Boston College sports business professor Warren Zola. </p>

            <p>That middle ground will be a result of mounting pressure from the court cases before Wilken, he continued. </p>

            <p>The judge is interested in incremental changes, according to plaintiff's attorney Bruce Simon, adding that rules allowing an open market for players would have to come from within the association. </p>

            <p>Responding to characterizations that Wilken's injunction is a moral victory for the NCAA because it seemingly upholds key tenets of amateurism, the Pearson, Simon &amp; Warshaw LLP partner emphasized the gains for the majority of student-athletes. The uncapping of benefits related to education, namely funds for post eligibility scholarships, is a significant improvement to the current model because most will not go professional. </p>

            <p>&quot;These could be huge,&quot; Simon said. &quot;What this means is that if a student-athlete wants to go to graduate school at the college he played at or at a different place, the NCAA member institutions could decide on their own to pay for that, and the NCAA cannot limit that amount.&quot; </p>

            <p>The judge also lifted restrictions on non-cash education-related benefits and academic awards to be provided on top of grant-in-aid scholarships. Her list of items that could be an education-related benefit include computers, science equipment and tutoring.  NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said in a statement that Wilken's decision &quot;recognizes that college sports should be played by student-athletes,&quot; and &quot;acknowledges that the popularity of college sports stems in part from the fact that these athletes are indeed students.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;Although the court rejected the plaintiffs' desire for a free market system, we will explore our next steps as appropriate.&quot;  &quot;We believe the ruling is inconsistent with the decision by the 9th [U.S.] Circuit Court of Appeals in O'Bannon. That decision held that the rules governing college athletics would be better developed outside the courtroom, including rules around the education-related support that schools provide,&quot; Remy said. </p>

            <p>Understanding the constraints the judge was working under after her remedy in O'Bannon was overturned, Wilken's language in the order actually indicates she believed plaintiff's attorneys when they argued &quot;in a free market, things would work itself out and college sports fans would not stop tuning in,&quot; according to sports management attorney Ricky Volante of Buckley King. </p>

            <p>&quot;I think she wanted to go the distance,&quot; he said. &quot;Reading through it, it almost seems like she's struggling with herself. There's this internal struggle going on with her that she knew where she needed to come out but knew what she wanted to say.&quot; </p>

            <p>In response to a proposed alternative that would eliminate all NCAA limits on compensation, Wilken wrote that conferences would act in their best economic interest to preserve consumer demand. The market will determine the level of compensation to student-athletes that will encourage competition but not reduce demand for their product, according to the order. </p>

            <p>But just a sentence later, the judge writes &quot;be that as it may, the inevitable trial-and- error phase could result in miscalculations by one or more conferences as to levels of cash pay that would not reduce demand for the product, and this could produce unintended consequences.&quot; </p>

            <p>Zola emphasized the 9th Circuit has more readily believed the NCAA's argument that there is a clear demarcation between collegiate and professional athletics. While Wilken may disagree, she has to work under those constraints, he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;This is definitely a promotion of NCAA interests over university athlete interests,&quot; Gould said. &quot;This opinion, and the O'Bannon opinion in particular, can only be understood through the concept of deference to universities.&quot; </p>

            <p>Despite those limitations, Wilken was deliberate and clever in expanding the scope of benefits allowable under higher court rulings, Volante said. </p>

            <p>Wilken intentionally used the term benefits &quot;related to education&quot; rather than benefits &quot;tethered to education,&quot; the latter of which was used in the 9th Circuit opinion to prohibit benefits not directly &quot;tethered&quot; to the education of a student-athlete.  By using benefits &quot;related to education,&quot; Wilken was able to broaden the scope of benefits by including items that are simply &quot;related&quot; to the educational experience of a student-athlete. </p>

            <p>&quot;She is trying to expand that definition and the injunction backs that up with the NCAA and conferences being provided with the opportunity to present a proposed order as to what relates to educational benefits,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs' attorneys can move for sanctions or other relief if they believe the injunction is being violated, according to Wilken's ruling. </p>

            <h5>Plaintiffs’ lawyers in Monsanto weedkiller trial face tough hurdles</h5>
            <p> A San Francisco County jury found that Monsanto Co.'s signature weed killer caused a dying man's cancer last year, but the consolidated cases that open in federal court Monday will most likely have a much steeper hill to climb, legal experts say. </p>

            <p>Attorneys representing thousands of people diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma face formidable hurdles on multiple fronts, including the trial being split into two phases and the exclusion of critical pieces of evidence that were allowed in the state court case. </p>

            <p>&quot;It's going to be hard [to prove causation], because what we're talking about is a plausible biological link,&quot; said Stanford Law School professor David M. Studdert. &quot;It's not a home run for the plaintiffs in this case.&quot; </p>

            <p>The bifurcated trial will only consider issues of causation in the first phase. If the nine-person jury, which is composed of seven women and two men, finds the agrochemical company liable, it will then hear allegations of misconduct and whether additional damages are warranted. </p>

            <p>The first of the test cases start before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of San Francisco. </p>

            <p>Edwin Hardeman is alleging exposure to Roundup was a substantial contributing factor in his development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which he was diagnosed with in 2015. <span class="ital">In re Roundup Products Liability Litigation</span>, 16-MD02741 (N.D. Cal., led Oct. 4, 2016). </p>

            <p>The defense argued splitting the trial would avoid undue delay, while plaintiffs' attorneys contended the process is &quot;unheard of&quot; in modern multi-district litigation. </p>

            <p>&quot;It is simply never done, and for good reason,&quot; wrote plaintiffs' attorney R. Brent Wisner.  While it is reasonable the court does not want evidence of misconduct influencing the jury's judgment on the scientific questions, the pretrial rulings, namely the bifurcation, were largely favorable for the company, now owned by Bayer AG, according to UC Hastings College of Law Professor David Levine. </p>

            <p>Studdert also said that the splitting of the trial should be of particular concern for plaintiffs' attorneys because even if they emerge victorious in this case, they have to prove specific causation in all the other cases if they go to trial. </p>

            <p>&quot;There are two mountains to climb,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Unlike the state court case, much of the evidence concerning the International Agency for Research on Cancer's conclusion that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen will be excluded, as will evidence of the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to classify glyphosate as &quot;not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.&quot; </p>

            <p>Chhabria has previously referred to the opinions of many of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses as &quot;shaky,&quot; in his order on summary judgment. </p>

            <p>While the fact of both agencies' classifications will be admissible at both phases, expert witnesses will not be allowed to discuss the matter &quot;to avoid wasting time or misleading the jury, as the primary inquiry is what the scientific studies show, not what [they] concluded they show,&quot; Chhabria wrote in his rulings on motions in limine. </p>

            <p>The judge emphasized the experts &quot;must limit their scientific testimony to their own independent conclusion.&quot; </p>

            <p>In another blow to plaintiffs' attorneys, Chhabria also prohibited references to Monsanto's ghostwriting of studies in the first phase of the trial. </p>

            <p>Levine said the judge most likely thought the probative value of testimony concerning the company's efforts to influence the science would be outweighed by its prejudicial value, but that he could have balanced the dispute better by allowing limited testimony on the issue. </p>

            <p>He added that much of this case could come down to who tells a more compelling narrative, which plaintiffs' attorneys are disadvantaged by because allegations of misconduct are not allowed in the first phase of the trial. </p>

            <p>References to Monsanto's marketing materials, other litigation and certain studies and internal records were also excluded.  &quot;No matter what happens here, it's not the end of the story,&quot; Levine said. &quot;We're still at the very beginning of this whole saga.&quot; </p>

            <h5>Smaller groups in opioid case concerned their interests will be lose out </h5>
            <p>With the first test case over allegations that drug makers and distributors are responsible for the nationwide opioid epidemic approaching in May, some plaintiffs that are a part of the consolidated litigation in Ohio are concerned their interests are not being properly represented by the lead attorneys, according to legal observers. </p>

            <p>San Mateo County, which has suffered &quot;devastating social and economic consequences,&quot; according to a lawsuit led in federal court Thursday, does not have much to worry about because they have a seat on the leadership table, but class action and Native American plaintiffs, among others, might be vulnerable because there is a limited pool of money. </p>

            <p>&quot;Given there's got to be some ceiling to how much they can pay out and that so much of it will end up going to states and cities, what's going to be left for class actions brought by individuals?&quot; said Loyola School of Law professor Adam Zimmerman. &quot;I'm thinking of people not a part of this litigation as being especially vulnerable.&quot; </p>

            <p>Plaintiffs' attorney David A. Domina similarly expressed concern for the Native American tribes in Nebraska he is representing.  &quot;If it's a contest for limited funds, we want to be sure tribes are treated separately and distinctly,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Anne Marie Murphy of Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP will represent San Mateo County in the Ohio multidistrict litigation. Drug manufacturers, including Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., heavily contributed to increased expenditures related to drug treatment, law enforcement and social services, according to the complaint. </p>

            <p>The county is alleging public nuisance, unfair competition and fraudulent concealment, among other claims. <span class="ital">County of San Mateo v. Prudue Pharma LP et al.</span>, 19-CV00949 (N.D. Cal., led Feb. 21, 2019). </p>

            <p>Murphy said she expects the lawsuit to be consolidated with the other opioid lawsuits in front of U.S. District Judge Dan Polster of the Northern District of Ohio. <span class="ital">In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation</span>, 17-MD2804 (N.D. Ohio, led Dec. 12, 2017). </p>

            <p>Settlement discussions have been ongoing, according to Domina, who added an upcoming Oklahoma state court case against drug manufacturers in May before Superior Court Judge Thad Balkman will serve as a model for what damages might look like.  The outcome could provide leverage to the victor for settlement negotiations in the larger federal cases, according to University of Georgia School of Law Professor Elizabeth C. Burch, against drug manufacturers. </p>

            <p>Orange County Superior Court Judge Kim Dunning will oversee allegations by several counties and cities, including Los Angeles and Oakland, against major pharmaceutical companies in a trial scheduled for June. <span class="ital">County of Orange v. Purdue Pharma</span>, 14-00725287 (Orange County Super. Ct., led May 21, 2014). </p>

            <p>But Zimmerman said several obstacles remain to reaching a settlement that would resolve all claims even if the outcomes are unfavorable to the defense in both the Oklahoma case, the Orange County case, and the first Ohio bellwether federal case scheduled for trial in October. </p>

            <p>Among the challenges is overcoming duplicative claims for damages alleged by multiple parties. For example, money a state attorney general would collect if it settles with the defendants would overlap with claims by other entities and would most likely resolve all other claims, including those brought by cities and municipalities, according to Zimmerman. </p>

            <p>A potential master settlement agreement would severely impact the class plaintiffs seeking individual recovery against opioid drugmakers and distributors because they would most likely be last in line for damages, he said. </p>

            <p>&quot;With this many interest groups, all of them are at risk of getting the short end of the stick, which is why a global settlement is so sticky and difficult,&quot; Zimmerman said. &quot;Most people understand there is not enough money to cover all the damage that's been done.&quot; </p>

            <p>Attorneys representing smaller interest groups in the litigation have also said they have a muted voice in the settlement conversations, according to legal observers. </p>

            <p>&quot;Polster appoints attorneys but not on the basis of adequate representation,&quot; said Burch. &quot;Native American tribes have legitimate questions about being adequately represented and whether that translates to poor substantive outcomes is certainly a concern.&quot;   Polster eased some of those concerns when he created a separate track for Native American plaintiffs, according to Domina. But the attorney generals of states with low Native American populations &quot;want to toss that number into the pool with no differentiation [from other plaintiffs],&quot; he added. </p>

            <p>The tribes' claims are distinct because their doctors are, for the most part, provided by Indian Health Services and there are also medical and cultural issues surrounding Native Americans that &quot;warrant the cases being grouped together,&quot; Domina wrote in an amicus brief. </p>

            <h5>State appellate court employees renew push for harassment policy</h5>
            
            <p>Supporters of a petition circulating around the Court of Appeal are trying to breathe new life into an initiative calling for increased transparency when reporting allegations of sexual harassment. </p>
            <p>In the wake of sexual harassment claims against two appellate justices, court employees are reviving a campaign to revise policies for the reporting and adjudication of complaints. </p>

            <p>The employees, mostly staff attorneys, say the mechanism for handling harassment allegations is murky when it involves a judge. </p>

            <p>&quot;In light of current events, in the context of what's been going on with the #MeToo movement and certain stories we've heard in the Legislature, it just seems like the more open we are and the more people feel comfortable raising things, the better&quot;, said Lyn Hinegardner, an attorney for the 1st District. &quot;It's something that's worth looking at and re-evaluating.&quot; </p>

            <p>Justices Jim Humes and Sandra Margulies of the 1st District Court of Appeal and Luis Lavin and Thomas Willhite Jr. of the 2nd District breathed new life into a petition calling for increased transparency and accountability when reporting allegations of sexual harassment when they signed this week. </p>

            <p>One hundred and twenty seven appellate court employees have now signed. The petition is here (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8lnlkvm)  .  Marguiles declined to comment. Lavin and Willhite could not be reached Thursday. </p>

            <p>A majority of signatories come from the 2nd District, where a state highway patrol officer alleged in July that Justice Jeffrey Johnson had sexually harassed her for years. He continues to work at the court. </p>

            <p>&quot;I signed the petition because I believe it is good policy to establish clear sexual harassment policies based on research (best practices) and factual data (a survey and review of past incidents),&quot; wrote Rita Himes, an attorney for the 1st District, in an email. &quot;I believe the court should be proactive on the issue, and I wanted to support colleagues for whom this appears to be a salient concern.&quot; </p>

            <p>Employees from the 2nd District who signed the petition and were interviewed this week said they were not willing to be identified by name in this article. </p>

            <p>An attorney for the Court of Appeal who is among the leaders advocating for the petition and also declined to be identified said, &quot;Clearly, the court's policies have failed to protect its employees, and reform is needed.&quot; </p>

            <p>Employees do not know where to submit complaints and do not have confidence they will be addressed appropriately or in a timely manner, according to another 2nd District attorney who signed the petition. &quot;It doesn't feel particularly safe to report it here,&quot; she said. </p>

            <p>Employees receive sexual harassment training, but it is geared toward preventing misconduct and does not discuss what to do when it occurs, especially by justices.   &quot;Training is so geared toward employee-to-employee sexual harassment, which is very different than a justice who is the one engaging in inappropriate conduct,&quot; said the female 2nd District attorney. </p>

            <p>The working group needs to establish a centralized body to submit complaints that does not &quot;serve at the pleasure of the justices, so that you can have confidence&quot; in the reporting process, she added. </p>

            <p>Current policy directs employees to report complaints of misconduct to supervisors, human resource officers or the administrative presiding justice -- all of whom have discretion about how to respond. The petition seeks the creation of an independent, centralized body that would revise procedures and policies for addressing and investigating claims at every district.  The working group would be composed of judges, research attorneys and court employees, unlike its federal counterpart -- which is composed solely of judges. </p>

            <p>The matter is still under review by the Judicial Council, according to spokesman Peter Allen. </p>

            <p>Federal courts revised the judicial confidentiality policy and created a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals director of workplace environment, who can counsel judges and employees confidentially on harassment and discrimination issues, in July in response to the December retirement of 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski following accusations of misconduct. </p>

            <p>The petition referenced the retirement of 6th District Court of Appeal Presiding Justice Conrad Rushing as an example of when the court's existing sexual harassment policy failed. </p>

            <p>Rushing, like Kozinski, retired in December after allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination were investigated by an outside law rm. But the justice continued to serve for six months before stepping down. </p>

            <p>Another Court of Appeal attorney who initially supported the petition when it was presented at a judicial attorneys' conference in April said she has been thinking of removing her signature. The petition was initially a &quot;general plan,&quot; which called for increased transparency in the reporting process, but has progressed to include specific provisions. </p>

            <p>&quot;I generally support the idea that these kinds of allegations should be reviewed and should be treated seriously and the process should be relatively transparent,&quot; she said. &quot;I've just been really surprised at the coverage this has gotten since then that it's become this controversial thing.&quot; </p>

            <p>Two other attorneys for the Court of Appeal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the petition was never meant as a panacea and that it was a simply a vehicle for recognizing there is an issue that must be addressed. </p>

            <p>&quot;What we purport to know is that the current system does not work and that there needs to be input by employees rather than have it done simply by the justices or, frankly, people at the [Judicial Council] who don't live in the same situation we live in,&quot; one said.  </p>

            <h5>Few Options for addressing judicial harassment</h5>
            <p>Judges are constitutional officers with great authority to determine how allegations against them are investigated at least initially.</p>

            <p>It took six months last year for Justice Conrad Rushing to leave the 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose after an initial review into allegations he had harassed employees and engaged in other workplace misconduct. </p>

            <p>The court has not disclosed when the alleged misconduct was first disclosed but Rushing&rsquo;s case points to a problem facing courts dealing with accusations of harassment: Judges aren&rsquo;t employees who can be summarily placed on administrative leave while allegations against them are investigated. </p>

            <p>They are constitutional officers with great authority to determine how allegations against them are investigated, at least in the initial stage. </p>

            <p>With allegations of misconduct facing 2nd District Court of Appeal Justice Jeffrey Johnson, the court now faces a similar problem. </p>

            <p>A California Highway Patrol officer assigned to drive Johnson to official functions told investigators the justice repeatedly made lewd comments and requested sex, prompting her to seek a transfer to another division of the CHP. A summary of the allegations reviewed by the Daily Journal appeared to suggest other women have accused Johnson. </p>

            <p>The court has no authority to take action against Johnson, even if officials believe the allegations have merit.  Johnson, based in Los Angeles, is still on the bench. Calls to the court and to Johnson seeking comment for this article were not returned. </p>

            <p>Judicial officers cannot be suspended from office, even temporarily, until the Commission on Judicial Performance &mdash; the independent agency with the authority to discipline judges &mdash; completes its investigation and files formal charges. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Only the Commission on Judicial Performance has the authority to discipline a judge,&rdquo; said Judicial Council senior attorney Mark Jacobson. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a complaint against a judge, the court needs to look into it, but they can&rsquo;t do anything about the judge.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>The standards are set out in the Rule 120 (b) of the Commission on Judicial Performance. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Before the commission has reached a determination regarding removal or retirement of a judge, the commission may temporarily disqualify a judge without loss of salary upon notice of formal proceedings pursuant to article VI, section 18(b) of the California Constitution if the commission determines that the continued service of the judge is causing immediate, irreparable, and continuing public harm,&rdquo; the rule states. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;The utility of the provision would be for when there&rsquo;s clear potential for ongoing harm to public protection,&rdquo; said Commission on Judicial Performance Director-Chief Counsel Gregory Dresser. &ldquo;In circumstances where it would be appropriate, you would want the ability to do that.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>But Dresser could only cite a single example of the provision being utilized, two decades ago. </p>

            <p>In 1998, former Ventura County Superior Court Judge Robert C. Bradley was suspended by the CJP after he was arrested for driving under the influence multiple times, according to Dresser. </p>

            <p>Dresser said there may be a more recent use of the provision but he couldn&rsquo;t recall it. </p>

            <p>The commission notified Bradley of formal proceedings against him in March 1998 and the following month &ldquo;issued an order of disqualification barring Judge Bradley from acting as a judge pending further order of the commission or until the completion of formal proceedings,&rdquo; according to commission records. </p>

            <p>If the CJP doesn&rsquo;t file charges, a judge can continue to go to work. </p>

            <p>That&rsquo;s what happened in the case of Rushing, the longtime presiding justice of the 6th District in San Jose. Officials with the appellate court contacted the Judicial Council, which helped to hire Sacramento law rm Ellis Buehler Makus to investigate the allegations. According to the San Jose Mercury News, the report was completed in May 2017 and forwarded to the CJP. </p>

            <p>In the meantime, Rushing continued to serve as a justice. The commission never led charges against him, and he quietly resigned in October 2017, with an effective date of Dec. 4. </p>

            <p>The 6th District did not respond to a query on whether the court accommodated complainants, who included employees in his courtroom, before Rushing resigned. Ellis Buehler Makus did not return a phone call seeking comment. </p>

            <p>Dresser could not con rm whether Rushing was investigated. He also declined to comment on whether Johnson is being investigated. </p>

            <p>No judicial branch agency, including the commission, has authority to mandate workplace accommodations, such as counseling or reassignment, to address allegations of misconduct against judicial officers, according to Dresser. </p>

            <p>The commission can only impose one of five disciplinary measures &mdash; removal from office, public censure, public admonishment, private admonishment or an advisory letter &mdash; and only after a formal investigation is completed. </p>

            <p>No discipline can be imposed outside of those actions, and the commission is not empowered to force a judicial officer to take any action to accommodate complainants or witnesses, according to Dresser. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;No, they can&rsquo;t force them to do anything,&rdquo; Dresser said. </p>

            <p>The council declined to comment on whether it facilitated finding a rm to investigate allegations against Johnson.  An individual with a complaint of misconduct against a judicial officer can take it to the commission or the court&rsquo;s presiding judicial officer, according to Dresser. </p>

            <p>The presiding judicial officer who is notified of a claim of misconduct against a judge, justice, or commissioner will typically conduct an investigation to determine the validity of the complaint before referring it to the commission, he said. </p>

            <p>California Rules of Court 10.603 mandates presiding judicial officers notify the commission of &ldquo;a judge&rsquo;s substantial failure to perform judicial duties...,&rdquo; which Dresser said includes allegations of sexual harassment. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Whenever a judge has reliable information that another judge has violated any provision of the Code of Judicial Ethics, that judge shall take appropriate corrective action, which may include reporting the violation to the appropriate authority,&rdquo; state Supreme Court spokesperson Cathal Conneely wrote in an email. </p>

            <h5>Courts’ revelations of misconduct settlements leave many unanswered questions</h5>
            <p>State courts have paid over $1.1 million since 2010 to settle claims of sexual harassment and discrimination against judicial officers and court employees, according to judicial administrative records obtained by the Daily Journal.</p>
            <p>The courts that paid settlements include those in Alameda, Tulare, El Dorado, Lassen, San Bernardino, Alpine, Tehama, Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties. Several of the settlements involve court employees and not judicial officers. The names of individuals who were accused of wrongdoing are not included in the settlement agreements, with a single exception.</p>
            <p>The names of the judges and the nature of the claims of misconduct also remain unknown in most agreements. The records provided by the Judicial Council and the state courts were heavily redacted.</p>
            <p>The Judicial Council &mdash; at the direction of Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye &mdash; amended the California Rules of Court 10.500 in June to provide public access to judicial administrative records concerning judicial officers who have resolved complaints of settlements &ldquo;for which public funds were spent in payment of the settlement, including any settlement agreement[s] arising from claims or complaints of sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In 2018, we need to rebalance the protections within the rule to ensure that they do not undermine public trust and con dence in the judicial branch or access to information about how taxpayer funds are being spent,&rdquo; Cantil-Sakauye said.</p>
            <p>Because California Public Records Act requests do not apply to the judicial branch, the Judicial Council adopted procedures concerning judicial administrative records in 2010 to &ldquo;provide public access to nondeliberative and nonadjudicative court records, budget and management information.&rdquo; The rule provided that judicial officers were exempt from being named in these records.</p>
            <p>The group assigned to revise the rule in April, headed by 4th District Court of Appeal Justice Marsha G. Slough, amended the exemption to ensure that the names of judicial officers were not exempt from being disclosed.</p>
            <p>But the records disclosed by the Judicial Council and several superior courts leave it unclear in what capacity multiple judicial officers named in the settlements are involved in the claims of misconduct, if at all.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We note that it is common for settlement agreements to include the names of court executive officers and presiding and assistant presiding judges who sign the agreements on behalf of the court,&rdquo; a council spokesperson wrote in an email. &ldquo;The fact that a presiding or assistant presiding judge or court executive officer has signed an agreement on behalf of the court does not mean that he or she was named as a respondent or defendant in a claim or action.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The counties that paid the most to settle claims include Alameda County Superior Court, which spent $201,000 to resolve two claims of misconduct, and Los Angeles County Superior Court, which spent $322,000 to resolve four claims of misconduct from 2010 to 2012. Santa Clara County also spent $150,000 to resolve a sexual harassment claim in 2013.</p>
            <p>The three courts&rsquo; responsive documents did not name any judicial officers.</p>
            <p>The majority of the settlement agreements also include confidentiality clauses, such as one with Santa Clara County Superior Court.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Parties covenant that neither they nor their agents will, without compulsion of legal process, reveal to any person or entity (except immediate family members, accountants, attorneys or other professional advisors to whom the disclosure is necessary to effect the purposes for which they have consulted such advisors), directly or indirectly, disclose any of the terms of this Agreement or the settlement sum paid to Employee, nor any of the claims or facts which led to the Dispute,&rdquo; according to a June 2013 settlement agreement for $150,000.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Tulare County Superior Court settled a sexual harassment claim against former Judge Valeriano Saucedo for $120,000.Lassen County Superior Court also settled a sex discrimination claim for $135,000 in February 2018, according to records provided by the council. A former judicial officer and former clerk were defendants in the agreement.</p>
            <p>The court did not immediately respond for comment.</p>
            <p>Tehama County Superior Court settled a sex discrimination claim for $150,000 in 2015. The claim was brought by a former court employee against the court &ldquo;asserting that her termination from employment was based on gender discrimination and harassment, and also in retaliation for her protected activities, including whistleblower complaints.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>San Bernardino County resolved a sex discrimination claim in 2016 for $25,000. Alpine County resolved a similar claim in 2012 for $2,500.</p>

            <h5>Smaller groups in opioid case concerned their interests will be lose out </h5>
            <p>A Judicial Council rule intended to require the revelation of the names of judges when settlements are reached is not being followed, attorneys said.</p>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; Last month, the Judicial Council passed an amendment requiring the disclosure of settlement agreements involving judges accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct. California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauyehad personally called for the change.</p>
            <p>But county courts have been inconsistent in applying the rule, which is supposed to apply to any settlement agreement dating back to Jan. 1, 2010. One county court revealed a $175,000 settlement but declined to name the accused individual.</p>
            <p>Alameda County Superior Court released a long list of judicial administrative records dating back to 2010, revealing a $175,000 settlement the court paid in 2017. But the name of the judicial officer or court employee is redacted, which several attorneys said is a violation of the amendment.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble seeing a good reason as to why it was redacted,&rdquo; said David Snyder of the First Amendment Coalition, which specializes in increasing government accountability and transparency. &ldquo;They redacted the name of the court employee respondent, and that should be disclosed, regardless of whether the individual was a judge or a clerk.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Alameda County disclosed seven years worth of its judicial administrative records on an easily navigable website. But it redacted too much information, according to some attorneys.</p>
            <p>Snyder said Friday he suspected the respondent was a judge because of multiple references in the settlement agreement to the Judicial Council, which provides legal advice in complaints of misconduct against a judge.</p>
            <p>He also said California Rules of Court 10.500 could refer to non-judges because the Judicial Council also uses the term, &ldquo;subordinate judicial officers,&rdquo; which could include court staff.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In context of the language, it makes it seem like judicial officers refer to staff,&rdquo; Snyder said.</p>
            <p>Mary-Alice Coleman, a labor attorney with the Law Of ce of Mary-Alice Coleman who is a member of the Consumer Attorneys of California, which is co-sponsoring a bill that would prevent individuals and businesses from entering into secret settlements in sexual harassment and discrimination cases, said the court violated the rule by redacting the names of judicial officers.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What needs to be very clear, and I assume is the point, is that because it&rsquo;s a judicial officer who was named as a wrongdoer, they can&rsquo;t just redact that name,&rdquo; Coleman said. &ldquo;It says you can&rsquo;t redact the name of any judicial officer anyway, regardless of whether he&rsquo;s a respondent or complainant.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In response to a Daily Journal request under the California Public Records Act, Alameda County Superior Court Executive Officer Chad Finke declined to say if any of the settlements involved a judge accused of misconduct.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Under rule 10.500, we are obligated to produce responsive judicial administrative records,&rdquo; Finke said in a statement Friday. &ldquo;Here we have produced all records that we have that are responsive to your May 31, 2018, request. I believe that ful lls our responsibility under the amended rule.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Other counties have also set up roadblocks to obtaining judicial administrative records.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles and San Diego county superior courts require public records requests to be mailed or hand-delivered. The Los Angeles court also requests advance payment for the cost of copying records and labor, which Judicial Council spokesman Peter Allen said it should not be doing.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The irony is there are so few judges that have been subjected to this, that by resisting it, it makes it worse,&rdquo; Allen said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh, they must be hiding something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The mechanisms for the disclosure of these records were largely left to the individual courts, according to 4th District Court of Appeal Justice Marsha G. Slough, who chaired the group that pioneered the expedited revision at Cantil-Sakauye&rsquo;s request.</p>
            <p>Putting each county court&rsquo;s records concerning judicial officers who have resolved complaints of misconduct on a centralized location managed by the council was not discussed because it has &ldquo;very little direct control, so to speak, over the 58 independent superior court systems,&rdquo; according to Slough.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I think all that the Judicial Council can do is direct the trial court to follow the rules of court,&rdquo; Slough said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert, but my general thought is that no, we could not ask, because the council is the policymaking body of the judicial branch.&rdquo;</p>

            <h5>Persky recall may already be having an impact on other judges, lawyers say </h5>
            <p>The campaign to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky may encourage judges to impose harsher sentences rather than offer alternative rehabilitation options, according to some legal experts who expressed concerns that a successful recall will affect judicial independence. </p>

            <p>The campaign to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky may encourage judges to impose harsher sentences rather than offer alternative rehabilitation options, according to some legal experts who expressed concerns that a successful recall will affect judicial independence. Others disagree. </p>

            <p>&quot;There's going to be a pressure on judges to be harsh rather than perhaps deciding the case on the facts of the law,&quot; said McManis Faulkner attorney Jim McManis, who said he is Persky's lawyer. &quot;It's easier to throw the book at defendants than take a chance and give them probation.&quot; </p>

            <p>The leader of the recall effort -- Michele Dauber, a professor at Stanford Law School - - dismissed those concerns as overblown fears that do not give judges enough credit when making sentencing decisions. </p>

            <p>&quot;Judges are capable enough to tell the difference between privileged, highs-status, elite offenders convicted of sex crimes and poor, low-status offenders,&quot; Dauber said. </p>

            <p>The recall campaign started after Persky sentenced Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student, to six months in jail for sexual assault on an unconscious woman. He served three months and he is appealing his conviction. <span class="ital">People v. Turner</span> , H043709 (Santa Clara Super. Ct., led June 2, 2016). </p>

            <p>If a majority of voters cast ballots to recall Persky, he would be replaced by one of two candidates seeking his seat: Assistant District Attorney Cindy Hendrickson or civil attorney Angela Storey. </p>

            <p>A Santa Clara County judge has already been influenced by the recall efforts, according to Santa Clara County Bar Association President Chris Burdick. </p>

            <p>Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Vincent J. Chiarello declined to approve a deal he helped facilitate in a case involving a defendant, Sean Ryan, who was charged with three felony counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor and would require him to register as a sex offender if convicted. <span class="ital">People v. Ryan</span> , B1685649 (Santa Clara Super. Ct., led April 15, 2016). </p>

            <p>After a defense expert concluded Ryan did not present a public safety threat, Chiarello and the prosecution agreed to reduce the charges to felony unlawful sexual intercourse, which does not require sex registration, in addition to having him serve a year in jail. But after the victim unexpectedly appeared at the sentencing hearing to give an impact statement, Chiarello decided to pull the plug on the deal and send Ryan to state prison. </p>

            <p>The judge said he agreed with the victim that Ryan continued to present a public safety threat, according to court transcripts.  Chiarello's decision came three days after Dauber announced she planned to put her campaign to remove and replace Persky from the bench on the June ballot. </p>

            <p>Defense attorney Philip Schnayerson, who represented Ryan, said his client was &quot;Turner-ed,&quot; a term they created to describe a judge imposing a harsher sentence on a defendant to avoid public scrutiny. </p>

            <p>Persky portrayed himself as a symbol of the threat to judicial independence at a press conference earlier this month, warning that politics will inevitably creep into the courtroom because judges will start to consider the public's opinion of their sentencing decisions due to the recall campaign. </p>

            <p>&quot;Judges will feel that silent, creeping, corrupting force of what happens if I decide X,&quot; Persky said. &quot;That's not what judges should be thinking about.&quot; </p>

            <p>Santa Clara County Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said the sentence Persky imposed &quot;is exactly what I would want for a ... client of mine under similar circumstances,&quot; explaining that the judge properly utilized his discretion to give Turner a chance at rehabilitation and said that mass incarceration is a result of judges who do not utilize this discretion. </p>

            <p>&quot;The punishment or removal of Judge Persky in response to his exercise of discretion could lead to policies that limit that discretion, will deter other judges from extending mercy and instead encourage them to issue unfairly harsh sentences for fear of reprisal,&quot; Singh added. </p>

            <p>Dauber said recall opponents &quot;have a very dim view of judicial integrity,&quot; adding that judges should not fear future recall efforts because the standard for getting one on the ballot is extremely high because of the number of signatures, money and mobilization it requires. </p>

            <p>Persky also said he does not expect a spate of judicial recalls even if his is successful. The effect will be &quot;more subtle and insidious,&quot; he warned, taking the form of litigants questioning if judges assigned to them can make unpopular decisions that may put their reputations and careers at stake. </p>

            <p>The state Legislature passed two bills in 2016 in response to the outcry over Turner's sentencing. Two of the crimes Turner was convicted of now carry a mandatory three- year prison sentence, which Santa Clara School of Law professor Ellen Kreitzberg said makes the recall effort unnecessary because it ensures a higher threshold of accountability for sexual assault crimes. </p>

            <p>But Dauber, who said she was not in support of the new mandatory minimum, said the state Legislature's response to Persky's abuse of discretion is even more of a reason to remove him from the bench. </p>

            <p>&quot;It's terrible the Legislature has taken away judicial discretion from 1,500 judges in order to deal with the problem of the one judge who did&quot; abuse discretion, Dauber said. &quot;Our solution is to remove the bad judge, not tie the hands of the good ones.&quot;  </p>

            <h5>Appellate court bail ruling prompts more pretrial releases, but only in some cases </h5>
            <p>Superior courts across the state are holding what have become known as Humphrey hearings to determine a defendant's financial status and consider bail alternatives in the wake of a 1st District Court of Appeal decision published in February. </p>

            <p>A San Francisco County judge released the man, Kenneth Humphrey, whose appeal was granted last week, but the appellate opinion has had varied results across the state. <span class="ital"> In re Humphrey (2018)</span> 19 Cal. App. 5th 1006. </p>

            <p>The impact of the Humphrey hearings largely depend on the district attorney's opposition to pretrial release and the judge's discretion when considering a defendant's flight risk and threat to public safety, according to public defenders. </p>

            <p>&quot;We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that,&quot; said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. &quot;But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail.&quot; </p>

            <p>San Francisco County prosecutors have started to advocate solely for no bail orders when it believes the defendant is a public safety threat or conditional release when it does not believe so, according to San Francisco district attorney's office spokesperson Max Szabo. Monetary bail is only imposed when the defendant poses a flight risk, he added. </p>

            <p>&quot;The Humphrey decision came out which [said] that bail should only be set beyond what the defendant can reasonably afford to pay if the court articulates the fact that the individual is either likely to not come back to court and if there are no less restrictive means to ensure that the individual comes back for their court date,&quot; Szabo said. </p>

            <p>Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi also said the Humphrey decision has had the effect of judges imposing &quot;no bail more often than they ever did before.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;We have the same number of pretrial misdemeanor clients in jail as we did before Humphrey,&quot; Pozzi said. &quot;This is very disheartening.&quot; </p>

            <p>The shift in the office's approach to pretrial release has led to a significant increase in the number of defendants released prior to trial. In February and March 2017, 1,051 defendants were out on conditional release, according to San Francisco Sheriff Vicki Hennessy. </p>

            <p>That figure jumped to 1,616, nearly a 50 percent increase, in February and March this year, while the number of total bookings remained relatively similar from the same period last year. </p>

            <p>The number of defendants released on the highest level of supervision went up more than 30 percent in March, Hennessy added. She attributed this to the increase in defendants released after felony arrests for crimes such as second degree burglary, child pornography and battery of a peace officer. </p>

            <p>But Adachi said the district attorney's change in its approach fails to address what he said is the constitutional right to pretrial release. </p>

            <p>More defendants are being held on no bail orders despite more individuals being released prior to trial, Adachi said.  &quot;By taking that position, the district attorney's office, in my opinion, is working to defeat bail reform,&quot; he added. </p>

            <p>In Santa Clara County, Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said arraignment attorneys come prepared with information about their client's ability to pay, ties to the community and programs appropriate to help their client in a &quot;Humphrey-tailored request at the beginning of the arraignment.&quot; </p>

            <p>But Santa Clara County prosecutors have not changed their approach to bail and &quot;haven't meaningfully engaged about what kind of pretrial release conditions t each person's case,&quot; he added. </p>

            <p>Although Singh acknowledged more defendants are being let go on conditional release or on their own recognizance, the response has largely depended on the judge hearing the arraignment. Some judges are skeptical about evidence presented by public defenders concerning their clients' ability to pay and set bail as they did before Humphrey. </p>

            <p>In Santa Clara County, there has been a 10 percent increase in defendants assigned to the supervised or own-recognizance release programs, according to Director of Pretrial Services Aaron Johnson. </p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County Superior Court bench's application of Humphrey has been mixed, according to Interim Public Defender Nicole Davis Tinkham. </p>

            <p>&quot;Some courts have embraced the individualized bail assessment mandated by Humphrey and are setting money bail only where no alternative exists, while others continue to condition release on the payment of huge amounts of money without regard for a defendant's particular circumstances,&quot; she said. </p>

            <p>Although they do not contest bail in specific cases, Los Angeles County public defenders actively monitor bail and seek higher court review when appropriate. But because these motions take time, &quot;many clients held on excessive bail in minor cases plead guilty in order to get out which, ironically, prevents us from seeking review of the court's erroneous bail order in the first place,&quot; Tinkham added.</p>

            <h5>Persky, facing recall, said his ouster would endanger judicial independence</h5>
            
            <p>Speaking out publicly for the rst time, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky argued Tuesday the judiciary&rsquo;s independence will be undermined if the campaign to recall him is successful.</p>
                <p>Persky, whose six-month sentence of a Stanford University swimmer for sexual assault on an unconscious woman prompted a recall campaign, said such efforts should be reserved for misconduct or incompetence and not to unseat judges who make unpopular&nbsp;decisions.</p>
                <p>During a press conference at a private residence that organizers asked not to be disclosed, Persky focused less on defending his sentencing decision in the Brock Turner case than in casting himself as a symbol of endangered judicial independence.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Our system of government cannot function the way our nation&rsquo;s founders intended if the courts are reduced to being political weather vanes,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;When a group threatens to recall one judge because they disagree with a ruling, they threaten all judges. They threaten the independence of the judiciary.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Politics will creep into the courtroom because judges will start to consider the public&rsquo;s opinion of their sentencing decisions in the wake of the recall campaign, Persky warned. He added the winds can easily shift and that a conservative county can use this tactic to unseat progressive judges over an unpopular decision there.</p>
                <p>When asked if community values should play any part in a judge&rsquo;s sentencing consideration, Persky said the California Code of Judicial Ethics and the state Constitution instruct judges to do the exact opposite &mdash; to not let public opinion in uence their decisions.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it ethically,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to the Legislature to make laws, and it&rsquo;s up to judges to enforce those laws.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The judge said he does not expect a spate of judicial recalls even if this one is successful. The effect will be &ldquo;more subtle and insidious,&rdquo; taking the form of litigants questioning if judges assigned to them can make unpopular decisions that may put their reputations and careers at stake, he added.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Judges will feel that silent, creeping, corrupting force of what happens if I decide X,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what judges should be thinking about.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>But recall campaign organizer and Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber argued judicial recalls are an essential feature of the court system. Judges should be accountable to the voters in their counties because they are elected officials, she added.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Persky has a long pattern of bias in favor privileged men who commit violence against women,&rdquo; Dauber said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s repeatedly abused discretion and as a result, voters lost faith in his ability to be fair.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Both sides have accused the other of misrepresenting facts in the case of Turner, who served three months in jail for assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person.</p>
                <p>Recall opponents contended the opposition has unfairly attempted to frame Turner&rsquo;s sentencing as a larger pattern of bias toward similarly privileged, male offenders, while recall organizers argued that Persky&rsquo;s defenders have downplayed the judge&rsquo;s judicial discretion in the sentencing decision.</p>
                <p>The Commission on Judicial Performance and the Santa Clara County Bar Association concluded Persky did not display any pattern of bias.</p>
                <p>The state Legislature passed two bills in 2016 in response to the outcry over Turner&rsquo;s sentencing.Two of the crimes Turner was convicted of now carry a mandatory three- year prison sentence.</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Cindy Hendrickson and Angela Storey of Storey &amp; Storey will be on the June ballot, seeking Persky&rsquo;s seat if he is recalled.</p>

            <h5>Persky recall stirs angry debate about judicial independence </h5>
            <p>Two sides that typically consider themselves progressives find each other on opposite sides on the issue of judicial independence in the wake of a recall campaign for Santa Clara Superior Court judge Aaron Persky.</p>
            <p>Proponents of the recall argue it is necessary to balance judicial independence and accountability. They claim Persky demonstrated a history of bias in favor of men charged with sexual crimes and violence against women.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This is a feature, not a bug, of our system,&rdquo; said recall campaign organizer and Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber. &ldquo;Any system of judicial selection is balancing competing value sets of independence and accountability and democratic legitimacy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Recall opponents said the campaign to oust Persky is an attack on the judiciary&rsquo;s independence and that this tactic has been and will increasingly be used to unseat judges who issue unpopular decisions.</p>
            <p>They maintain recall proponents have cherry-picked cases that Persky presided over to criticize how women&rsquo;s rights are being addressed in the court system nationally.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re going to end up with is judges looking over their shoulders and putting their nger to the wind to assess what they should do,&rdquo; said former Santa Clara County Superior Court judge LaDoris Cordell. &ldquo;That is not an independent judiciary.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Both sides accused the other of mispresenting facts in the trial of former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner, who served three months in county jail after he was found guilty on three counts of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person.</p>
            <p>Persky&rsquo;s defenders contended recall organizers have unjusti ably attempted to frame the Turner trial as a snapshot of a larger pattern of bias toward similarly high-status, male offenders, while recall proponents say the opposition is downplaying Persky&rsquo;s use of judicial discretion in his sentencing decision.</p>
            <p>Santa Clara County Bar Association Chief Executive Of cer Chris Burdick said the bar&rsquo;s board came together to assess Persky&rsquo;s sentencing history in similar cases and concluded the recall campaign was citing trials in which plea deals were entered, and therefore don&rsquo;t re ect Persky&rsquo;s alleged leniency and use of discretion.</p>
            <p>The Commission on Judicial Performance also conducted a similar investigation and came to the conclusion that Persky had not exhibited bias in any of his past cases.</p>
            <p>Dauber said the commission&rsquo;s inquiry contained &ldquo;serious factual errors that make it impossible to rely on.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>McManis Faulkner attorney Elizabeth Pipkin, a lawyer for Persky, said the public&rsquo;s anger is misdirected because Persky&rsquo;s decision was within the recommendations made by the female probation of cer&rsquo;s report.</p>
            <p>She recommended a county jail sentence, which carries a maximum of one year, for an unspeci ed amount of time in addition to probation for three years, while the district attorney&rsquo;s of ce wanted Turner to serve six years in state prison.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;To the extent that people feel the sentence was lenient, part of that is what the law allows in these cases, and the law hasn&rsquo;t been changed nationally,&rdquo; Pipkin said. &ldquo;The focus should be changing the law instead of replacing judges following it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In response to the public outcry concerning Turner&rsquo;s sentencing, Gov. Jerry Brown signed two sexual assault bills in 2016, barring judges from granting probation to defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims.</p>
            <p>Under the new laws, two of the crimes Turner was convicted of would carry a mandatory three-year prison sentence, while probation would only be granted to someone convicted of the third crime Turner was convicted of, intent to commit rape, for cases with &ldquo;unusual circumstances,&rdquo; which Persky cited in the Turner trial.</p>
            <p>Cordell said this is most likely the rst of many recall campaigns to come. She added that the tactic has set a precedent that a community has the power to unseat a judge if he or she issues opinions they do not agree with. &ldquo;If this recall succeeds, judges will know that you can make one controversial or unpopular decision, but what you believe is right, and still get booted,&rdquo; Cordell said. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be willing to be lenient, out of fear that they&rsquo;re up next.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Shesaid she was alarmed when she realized that four deputy public defenders were challenging four incumbent San Francisco County Superior Court judges because they were appointed by Republican governors. She said the jduges have an excellent track record.</p>
            <p>Prominent plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney John Keker said the injection of partisan politics into state judicial elections has already had a chilling effect on the judiciary and that the deputy public defenders&rsquo; challenging the judges because of the governors&rsquo; political party is &ldquo;disturbing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;These public defenders have a right to run against the incumbents, but just because you have a right, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s defensible or a good thing,&rdquo; Keker said.</p>
            <p>Dauber said she doesn&rsquo;t want to con ate the recall efforts to the contested judicial elections in San Francisco.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Because we have this system that is balancing these competing value sets and because recall is used so infrequently, this would not reduce judicial independence,&rdquo; Dauber said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any impact to it. State judges in California are not fully independent.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Keker, who expressed no opinion on Persky&rsquo;s abilities as a judge, said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s terrible that he is being attacked in the way he has, especially by a Stanford law professor. ...&rdquo;</p>

            <h7>Jan 3, 2018</h7>
            <h5>Utilities may face large damage awards and no relief following blazes </h5>
            <p>A state regulatory agency&rsquo;s recent decision to reject a San Diego utility&rsquo;s request to pass on the costs from three deadly wild res that blazed through Southern California 10 years ago is an ominous warning for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which faces billions of dollars in claims due to the Wine Country res last fall. </p>

            <p>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. argued that the legal doctrine keeping it accountable for damages, inverse condemnation, unfairly holds the utility to an unreasonable standard. </p>

            <p>SDG&amp;E was forced to settle for $2 billion nearly 2,600 lawsuits spawned by three deadly 2007 blazes because of the legal theory. </p>

            <p>PG&amp;E could face similar liability for the same reason. </p>

            <p>The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has not completed its investigation into the cause of the fires yet. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think that there is a high likelihood PG&amp;E will have to pay out,&rdquo; said Gerald Singleton of Singleton Law Firm APC. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for me to envision how they will escape liability. Once we show the res were a result of the power lines, for inverse condemnation at least, that pretty much resolves the issue.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Under inverse condemnation, utilities are liable for all resulting property damages when their facilities cause a wildfire, whether or not the utility was negligent or engaged in any wrongful conduct. </p>

            <p>A December report by the California Department of Insurance estimated the destruction by the North Bay res at more than $8 billion in Napa, Mendocino and Napa counties. </p>

            <p>Southern California Edison also faces claims of liability for upwards of $2 billion in damages for the Thomas re, which is already the largest wildfire in California history. Multiple lawsuits have been led against the utility, claiming that construction crews working on a campground ignited dry vegetation and sparked the massive wildfire. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;You do not need to prove negligence and you don&rsquo;t have to prove a breach in the standard of care. The test is whether there&rsquo;s injury or harm to property caused by a public improvement as deliberately designed,&rdquo; said Frank Pitre of Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP, an attorney representing a plaintiffs&rsquo; group of Northern California wildfire survivors. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of causation, not fault,&rdquo; Pitre added. </p>

            <p>SDG&amp;E asked the California Public Utilities Commission to shift the $379 million not covered by its insurance from the three res to its ratepayers. </p>

            <p>Frank Pitre, a partner with Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP, says a recent state regulatory decision means plaintiffs don't need to prove negligence or poor standard of care to collect money if utilities are found to have sparked fires. </p>

            <p>The utility insisted that it responsibly managed its service territory while maintaining that the conditions leading up to the wild res in October 2007 were unprecedented &mdash; reasons why SDG&amp;E should be able to pass an additional $1.67 per month to its customers over a six-year period. </p>

            <p>PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison jumped into the case just prior to the North Bay wild res to support SDG&amp;E&rsquo;s proposal. They said the case highlights the larger question of how to fairly allocate costs from wild res. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;The [proposed decision] commits legal error by imposing a &lsquo;prudence&rsquo; condition on the recovery of reasonably incurred settlement and defense costs arising from inverse condemnation claims, which arbitrarily and disproportionately shifts the entire risk of any uninsured costs arising from a wildfire to the utility,&rdquo; wrote PG&amp;E senior counsel Michael Klotz in the utilities&rsquo; joint comments to the commission. </p>

            <p>The utilities said administrative law judges Pat Tsen and Sasha Goldberg, who wrote the proposed decision that the public utilities commission unanimously voted to accept, failed to account for the fact that applying inverse condemnation in fire liability cases presumes utilities will be able to spread costs by raising rates on consumers. </p>

            <p>These costs, the utilities said, should include the recovery of the full costs of settlements and legal defense incurred by SDG&amp;E resulting from inverse condemnation claims without having to conduct a prudence review. </p>

            <p>But the utilities commission decided in a 5-0 vote on Nov. 30 that SDG&amp;E did not act as a prudent manager in the wild res that destroyed more than 1,300 homes and killed two people. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no dispute that each of the res were caused by SDG&amp;E&rsquo;s facilities and in each instance we find that SDG&amp;E did not meet its burden to prove that it acted as a prudent manager,&rdquo; said Commissioner Liane Randolph. </p>

            <p>Although commission President Michael Picker said that the SDG&amp;E decision &ldquo;may or may not have any precedent for any future res that come before us,&rdquo; it does not bode well for PG&amp;E, which already said it would seek to recover costs if found liable for the Wine Country res. </p>

            <p>PG&amp;E has been watching the outcome of this decision particularly closely after state investigators said they were probing whether the utility&rsquo;s electrical equipment sparked the North Bay res, which killed 44 people and destroyed more than 8,900 homes. </p>

            <p>Hundreds of survivors have led dozens of suits against PG&amp;E, claiming the utility is liable for damages under inverse condemnation but also that it was negligent in the operation of its facilities. </p>

            <p>The increasing risk of insuring PG&amp;E has led to inflated premiums for the utility imposed by its various insurers. </p>

            <p>In a 2017 report to the utilities commission, which forecasts expenses for the next three years, PG&amp;E predicted its companywide administrative and general expenses to be $11 million more than a year before &mdash; primarily because of an &ldquo;increase in forecast insurance premiums and the purchase of additional insurance.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>The utility cautioned shareholders that it may not be able to find sufficient insurance coverage because of the strict liability standard applied to wild res under inverse condemnation. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;As a result of recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase of wild res, including as a result of the ongoing drought, ... the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the utility&rsquo;s current insurance coverage, or at all,&rdquo; PG&amp;E wrote in its 2016 annual report. </p>

            <p>Southern California Edison spokesman Brian Leventhal also said coverage has been increasingly difficult to find at comparable prices. </p>

            <p>Leventhal said the availability and cost of insurance is dependent on historical wildfire losses, forecasted weather conditions and an assessment of the utility&rsquo;s risk the carriers perform themselves. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Given the wildfire history in CA over the last several years, the application of strict liability to investor owned utilities, and current drought conditions, wildfire insurance has become increasingly expensive and capacity has diminished,&rdquo; Leventhal said in an email. &ldquo;We expect this trend will continue until conditions change.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>Conditions are not expected to get any more favorable to utilities as California state Senators Jerry Hill, Mike McGuire and Scott Wiener said they will introduce legislation later this month prohibiting utilities found at fault in wild res from passing costs onto customers. </p>

            <p>Utilities Commissioner Cliff Rechtschaffen said he does not hold utilities to a standard of perfection but added that the burden of proof is on them to prove that they responsibly manage their facilities. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t apply a standard that provides an incentive for utilities to act imprudently or unreasonably,&rdquo; Rechtschaffen said. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;If we ruled that recovery is possible with less than prudent management, then that would send the wrong signal,&rdquo; he said. </p>

            <p>If PG&amp;E were found to be liable for all costs in connection to the North Bay res, including damages to commercial and residential structures as well as fire suppression costs, it&rsquo;s unknown Whether the commission would allow the utility to recover costs from its ratepayers. </p>

            <p>If the cause of the North Bay fire were found to be attributable to the utility, PG&amp;E would have to prove that it responsibly managed its service territory before the commission considered allowing it to pass on uninsured costs to ratepayers. The utility was insured for $800 million, while attorneys for plaintiffs who are suing PG&amp;E claim it is liable for billions of dollars in damages.   If the cause of the res were to be laid PG&amp;E&rsquo;s door, Singleton commented, &ldquo;I think the CPUC is going to look at the evidence and determine what PG&amp;E&rsquo;s level of culpability was. If the negligence isn&rsquo;t overwhelming, given what they&rsquo;ve done in the past, the CPUC just might allow a pass-through&rdquo; &mdash; allowing the utility to charge ratepayers. </p>

            <p>Utilities Commissioner Martha Aceves said in the Nov. 30 SDG&amp;E decision that the strict liability applied to utilities in inverse condemnation cases rests on the incorrect premise that utilities are allowed to spread the costs of damages from wild res to its ratepayers. </p>

            <p>Aceves and Picker called on the state Legislature to re-examine the commission&rsquo;s authority to apportion responsibility and costs when determining liability for wild res so that utilities may be allowed to pass on some costs but not others, taking prudent management into account. </p>

            <h5>SF public defender’s bail challenges meeting resistance </h5>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The aggressive plan of San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi to challenge bail in every criminal ling back red Friday when a judge responded by increasing a defendant&rsquo;s bail by $20,000. </p>

            <p>Superior Court Judge Gerardo Sandoval made the decision following a testy exchange with Deputy Public Defender Crystal Carpino, who said her client&rsquo;s bail was &ldquo;unconstitutional and improper&rdquo; because it failed to take his financial circumstances under consideration. She asked that the defendant be released on his own recognizance. </p>

            <p>The judge agreed with prosecutor Tom Cullinan, who described defendant Amie Mangisel as &ldquo;a danger to the community&rdquo; based on a charge that he made a criminal threat and exhibited a deadly weapon while threatening to kill another person. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Bail should have been set even higher as he is a threat to public safety,&rdquo; Sandoval said. The judge then raised it from $15,000 to $35,000. <span class="ital">People v. Mangisel</span>, 17015365 (S.F. Super. Ct., led Oct. 19, 2017). </p>

            <p>Two reporters watched arrangments in different courtrooms on Friday morning. During that time, no judge released a jailed defendant or adopted a different system to evaluate them in response to Adachi&rsquo;s blanket policy to challenge bail, which he started Oct. 10. </p>

            <p>Adachi said he was prompted by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra&rsquo;s refusal to defend the system earlier this month in the 1st District Court of Appeal. <span class="ital">In re: Kenneth Humphrey</span>, A152056 (Cal. App. 1st Dist., led Aug. 4, 2017. He also cited a report released Tuesday by a group established by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, which called for the replacement of money bail.   Told of what transpired in court Friday morning, Adachi said: &ldquo;To hear that makes me wonder how many of these judges have read the report. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Bail is not supposed to be used as punishment. It&rsquo;s not about trying to keep people in jail. It shows how far we have to go.&rdquo;  Friday&rsquo;s result couldn&rsquo;t have been a surprise to the public defender. Last week, he said his efforts to lower or reduce bail in all criminal complaints had encountered resistance from judges. </p>

            <p>Back in Sandoval&rsquo;s courtroom, Carpino withdrew her motion to challenge bail for her next client after seeing what happened to Mangisel. Outside the courtroom she said she feared Sandoval would increase bail on that client, Marc Weiss, too. Weiss&rsquo; bail was $30,000 for a domestic violence charge. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;The courts are always saying it&rsquo;s a public safety risk but if that&rsquo;s all it was, then why did the person even have a chance to get out,&rdquo; Carpino said. &ldquo;If it were me, I&rsquo;d be out in 5 seconds because I can pay the bail, so it&rsquo;s really not really about community safety.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>In a third case before Sandoval, the defendant was released from jail after bail was posted. </p>

            <p>In another courtroom, Judge Tracy Brown denied Deputy Public Defender Everett Hewlett&rsquo;s bid to change a no-bail ruling for his client, Eric Hernandez.</p>

            <h5>San Francisco public defender’s office challenges bail on 282 criminal cases </h5>
            <p>San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi announced Wednesday that his office has led challenges to every criminal case in which bail was set since Oct. 10 in response to a California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s refusal to defend the system in court earlier this month.</p>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; San Francisco has led challenges to every criminal case in which bail was set since Oct. 10, Public Defender Jeff Adachi said Wednesday. The move was in response to a California Attorney General Xavier Becerra&rsquo;s refusal earlier this month to defend the system in court.</p>
            <p>Adachi also cited a report released Tuesday by a group established by Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye calling for the replacement of money bail. Adachi said in an interview that his of ce has appealed bail on 282 cases and would continue the practice indefinitely.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The California criminal justice system is addicted to bail, and it&rsquo;s going to be a challenging and difficult process to move the courts from the practice to a more enlightened approach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The purpose of bail isn&rsquo;t to keep someone locked up. It&rsquo;s supposed to consider a person&rsquo;s ability to pay and should primarily be based on whether they&rsquo;ll show up to court.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Becerra refused to defend the bail system after Kenneth Humphrey, a 64-year-old retired shipyard worker, appealed his $350,000 bail. The man was charged with first- degree residential robbery, theft, and in icting injury on an elder and dependent adult.</p>
            <p>The public defender challenged the bail, and a 1st District Court of Appeal panel ordered the attorney general to explain why Humphrey should not be released.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The Department of Justice has determined that it will not defend any application of the bail law that does not take into consideration a person&rsquo;s ability to pay, or alternative methods of ensuring a person&rsquo;s appearance at trial,&rdquo; Deputy Attorney General Katie L. Stowe wrote in the Oct. 2 ling. In re: Kenneth Humphrey, A152056 (Cal. App. 1st Dist., led Aug. 4, 2017).</p>
            <p>Adachi said he is trying to get judges to justify their rationale concerning high bail figures, especially when most of his clients have very little money and assets. Twenty percent of the appeals his office has led resulted in reduced bails or the defendant&rsquo;s release, he said.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not seeing judges shifting their thinking,&rdquo; Adachi said. &ldquo;The judges merely read from a script that says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re considering the individual&rsquo;s circumstances.&rsquo; That way, they have something written out to make a record of it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The public defender has employed a bail unit, composed of two attorneys and three support staff, to le additional motions. Courts are obligated to rehear bail motions within ve days if requested. State Sen. Robert Hertzberg has authored a bill making changes in the bail system similar to the recommendations made by the report from the chief justice. The state Senate approved the bill but Hertzberg said he would need to make additional compromises to get the bill through the Assembly.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Adachi said he isn&rsquo;t waiting on the Legislature. He called on other public defenders to follow his lead.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If this is something everyone does statewide, we can really begin moving the courts to adopt what the chief justice is saying needs to happen in terms of reform,&rdquo; Adachi said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a battle between now and the time when there is legislation that passes.&rdquo;</p>
